@---+ Package =TWiki::Users=

Singleton object that handles mapping of users to wikinames and
vice versa, and user authentication checking.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($session,$impl)</tt>

Construct the user management object



---++ ObjectMethod *finish* <tt></tt>

Complete processing after the client's HTTP request has been responded
to.
   1 breaking circular references to allow garbage collection in persistent
     environments



---++ ObjectMethod *findUser* <tt>($name[,$wikiname][,$nocreate]) -> $userObject</tt>

   * =$name= - login name or wiki name
   * =$wikiname= - optional, wikiname for created user
   * =$nocreate= - optional, disable creation of user object for user not found

Find the user object corresponding to =$name=, which may be either a
login name or a wiki name. If =$name= is found (either in the list
of login names or the list of wiki names) the corresponding
user object is returned. In this case =$wikiname= is ignored.

If they are not found, and =$nocreate= is true, then return undef.

If =$nocreate= is false, then a user object is returned even if
the user is not known.

If =$nocreate= is false, and no =$wikiname= is given, then the
=$name= is used for both login name and wiki name.

If nocreate is off, then a default user will be created with their wikiname
set the same as their login name. This user/wiki name pair can be overridden
by a later createUser call when the correct wikiname is known, if necessary.



---++ ObjectMethod *findUserByEmail* <tt>($email) -> \@@users</tt>
   * =$email= - email address to look up
Return a list of user objects for the users that have this email registered
with the password manager.



---++ ObjectMethod *createUser* <tt>($login,$wikiname) -> $userobject</tt>

Create a user, and insert them in the maps (overwriting any current entry).
Use this instead of findUser when you want to be sure you are not going to
pick up any default user created by findUser. All parameters are required.



---++ ObjectMethod *addUserToMapping* <tt>($user) -> $topicName</tt>

Add a user to the persistant mapping that maps from usernames to wikinames
and vice-versa.

---++ ObjectMethod *initializeRemoteUser* <tt>($remoteUser) -> $loginName</tt>

Return value: $remoteUser

Acts as a filter for $remoteUser.  If set, $remoteUser is filtered for
insecure characters and untainted.

If not user is passed, the remote user defaults to $cfg{DefaultUserLogin}
(usually 'guest').

If we got here via an authentication status failure, then the remote user
is set to blank, effectively signalling an illegal access.

If no remote user name was passed in, the user defaults to
$cfg{DefaultUserLogin}.
