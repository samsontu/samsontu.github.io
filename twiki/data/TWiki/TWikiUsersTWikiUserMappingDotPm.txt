---+ Package =TWiki::Users::TWikiUserMapping=

User mapping is the process by which TWiki maps from a username (a login name) to a wikiname and back. It is also
where groups are maintained.

By default TWiki maintains user topics and group topics in the %MAINWEB% that
define users and group. These topics are
   * !TWikiUsers - stores a mapping from usernames to TWiki names
   * !WikiName - for each user, stores info about the user
   * !GroupNameGroup - for each group, a topic ending with "Group" stores a list of users who are part of that group.

Many sites will want to override this behaviour, for example to get users and groups from a corporate database.

This class implements the basic TWiki behaviour using topics to store users, but is also designed to be subclassed
so that other services can be used.

Subclasses should be named 'XxxxUserMapping' so that configure can find them.

*All* methods in this class should be implemented by subclasses.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($session) -> $object</tt>

Constructs a new user mapping handler of this type, referring to $session
for any required TWiki services.



---++ ObjectMethod *finish* <tt></tt>

Complete processing after the client's HTTP request has been responded
to.
   1 breaking circular references to allow garbage collection in persistent
     environments



---++ ObjectMethod *getListOfGroups* <tt>() -> @listOfUserObjects</tt>

Get a list of groups defined by the mapping manager. By default,
TWiki defines groups using topics in the Main web. Subclasses should
override this to list groups from their own databases.

Returns a list of TWiki::User objects, one per group.



---++ ObjectMethod *addUserToMapping* <tt>($user,$addingUser) -> $topicName</tt>

Add a user to the persistant mapping that maps from usernames to wikinames
and vice-versa. The default implementation uses a special topic called
"TWikiUsers" in the users web. Subclasses will provide other implementations
(usually stubs if they have other ways of mapping usernames to wikinames).

Group names must be acceptable to $TWiki::cfg{NameFilter}

$user is the user being added. $addingUser is the user doing the adding.



---++ ObjectMethod *lookupLoginName* <tt>($username) -> $wikiName</tt>

Map a username to the corresponding wikiname. This is used for lookups during
user resolution, and should be as fast as possible.



---++ Objectmethod lookupWikiName($wikiname) -> $username

Map a wikiname to the corresponding username. This is used for lookups during
user resolution, and should be as fast as possible.


---++ ObjectMethod *getListOfAllWikiNames* <tt>() -> @wikinames</tt>

Returns a list of all wikinames of users known to the mapping manager.



---++ ObjectMethod *groupMembers* <tt>($group) -> @members</tt>

Return a list of user objects that are members of this group. Should only be
called on groups.

Note that groups may be defined recursively, so a group may contain other
groups. This method should *only* return users i.e. all contained groups
should be fully expanded.



---++ ObjectMethod *isGroup* <tt>($user) -> boolean</tt>

Establish if a user object refers to a user group or not.

The default implementation is to check if the wikiname of the user ends with
'Group'. Subclasses may override this behaviour to provide alternative
interpretations. The $TWiki::cfg{SuperAdminGroup} is recognized as a
group no matter what it's name is.
