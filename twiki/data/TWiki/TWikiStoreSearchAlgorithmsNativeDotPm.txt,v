@---+ Package =TWiki::Store::SearchAlgorithms::Native=

Native implementation of the RCS cache search. Requires tools/native_search
to be built and installed.

---++ search($searchString, $topics, $options, $sDir) -> \%seen
Search .txt files in $dir for $string. See RcsFile::searchInWebContent
for details.

Rude and crude, this makes no attempt to handle UTF-8.
