@---+ Package =TWiki::Search=

This module implements all the search functionality.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($session)</tt>

Constructor for the singleton Search engine object.



---++ StaticMethod *getTextPattern* <tt>($text,$pattern)</tt>

Sanitise search pattern - currently used for FormattedSearch only



---++ ObjectMethod *searchWeb* <tt>(...)</tt>

Search one or more webs according to the parameters.

If =_callback= is set, that means the caller wants results as
soon as they are ready. =_callback_ should be set to a reference
to a function which takes =_cbdata= as the first parameter and
remaining parameters the same as 'print'.

If =_callback= is set, the result is always undef. Otherwise the
result is a string containing the rendered search results.

If =inline= is set, then the results are *not* decorated with
the search template head and tail blocks.

Note: If =format= is set, =template= will be ignored.

Note: For legacy, if =regex= is defined, it will force type='regex'

SMELL: If =template= is defined =bookview= will not work

SMELL: it seems that if you define =_callback= or =inline= then you are
	responsible for converting the TML to HTML yourself!
	
FIXME: =callback= cannot work with format parameter (consider format='| $topic |'
