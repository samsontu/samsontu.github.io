@---+ Package =TWiki::OopsException=
*extends* <tt>Error</tt>


Exception used to raise a request to redirect to an Oops URL.
An OopsException thrown anywhere in the code will redirect the
browser to a url based on the =oops= script. =oops= requires a
=template= parameter, that is the name of a template file from
the =templates= directory. This file will be expanded and the
parameter values passed to the exception instantiated. The
result will be shown in the browser.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($template,...)</tt>
   * =template= is the name of an oops template
The remaining parameters are interpreted as key-value pairs. The following keys are used:
   * =web= will be used as the web for the oops
   * =topic= will be used as the topic for the oops
   * =def= - is the (optional) name of a TMPL:DEF within the template
   * =keep= - if set, the exception handler should try it's damndest to retain parameter values from the query.
   * =params= is a reference to an array of parameters. These will be substituted for !%PARAM1%, !%PARAM2% ... !%PARAMn% in the template.



---++ ObjectMethod *stringify* <tt>([$session]) -> $string</tt>

Generates a string representation for the object. if a session is passed in, and
the excpetion specifies a def, then that def is expanded. This is to allow
internal expansion of oops exceptions for example when performing bulk operations.
