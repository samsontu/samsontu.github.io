This is login manager that you can specify in the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. It instructs TWiki to
cooperate with your web server (typically Apache) to require authentication
information (username & password) from users. It requires that you configure
your web server to demand authentication for scripts named "login" and anything
ending in "auth". The latter should be symlinks to existing scripts; e.g.,
=viewauth -> view=, =editauth -> edit=, and so on.

See also TWikiUserAuthentication.

Subclass of TWiki::Client; see that class for documentation of the
methods of this class.
