<h3>Research/Professional Interests:</h3>


Modeling of biomedical ontologies and clinical guidelines and protocols, development of knowledge-based systems, knowledge
representation, databases, temporal database and temporal reasoning, protocol-based
health care
<h3> Personal Research Statement:</h3>Trained in computer science (with
specialization in artificial intelligence), my research revolves around
the representation of biomedical knowledge and the development of
computational methods to apply such knowledge to solve biomedical
problems. Over the years I have successfully worked with clinicians to
elicit and to represent and make computable clinical protocols and
guidelines and medical terminologies. Technically, I focus on (1) the
formal representation of and reasoning on biomedical concepts in
ontologies, and (2) the development of algorithms to apply such
representation in query systems and clinical decision support. I had
worked on projects that use such models to drive protocol-based
decision support and on projects where I developed novel
representations for autism, clinical research, and ICD-11 concepts.
<p>My work is done as part of the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">PROTEGE </a>, 
ATHENA and other
projects at Stanford and elsewhere. In these projects we are looking at ontology
development, meta-data representation, and protocols and guidelines in
breast cancer care, diabetes, hypertension, and other disease
areas.&nbsp;<br>
