<h3>Research/Professional Interests:</h3>


Modeling of biomedical ontologies and clinical guidelines and protocols, development of knowledge-based systems, knowledge
representation, temporal database, and temporal reasoning, protocol-based health care
<h3>Personal Research Statement:</h3>Trained in computer science (with
specialization in artificial intelligence), my research focuses on
the representation of biomedical knowledge and the development
of computational methods to apply that knowledge to solve biomedical
problems. Over the years, I have worked with clinicians to
elicit, represent, and make computable clinical protocols and
guidelines and medical terminologies. Technically, I focus on (1) the
formal representation of and reasoning about biomedical concepts in
ontologies, and (2) the development of algorithms to apply such
representation in query systems and clinical decision support. I have
worked on projects that use such models to drive protocol-based
decision support and on projects where I developed novel
representations for autism, clinical research, and ICD-11 concepts.
<p>My work is done as part of the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">PROTEGE</a>, 
ATHENA and other
projects at Stanford and elsewhere. In these projects, we are looking at ontology
development, meta-data representation, and protocols and guidelines in
breast cancer care, diabetes, hypertension, and other disease
areas.<br></p>
<p>
More recently, I have been active in the World Health Organization's Family of International Classifications Network, serving as co-chair of the Informatics and Terminology Committee in the past and, more recently, the Mapping Task Force. I worked on the harmonized content model for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Health Interventions (ICHI), and Functioning Disability and Health (ICF). I led the effort to investigate issues related to harmonizing the content of the three classifications within the WHO-FIC Foundation.
