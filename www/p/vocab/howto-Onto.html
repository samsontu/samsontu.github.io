<h1>How to use the Ontology Editor</h1>
<h2>at <a href="http://www-ksl-svc.stanford.edu:5915/"> 
http://www-ksl-svc.stanford.edu:5915/ </a>
 as an <em> InterMed Vocabulary Server. </em>
</h2>

Register as a new user, and send email to
<A HREF="mailto:ontology-librarian@ksl.stanford.edu">
ontology-librarian@ksl.stanford.edu</A> requesting to be added to the
InterMed group. As soon as you are a registered user, you may look at
various ontologies, but you won't be able to see the intermed ontologies,
since these aren't world readable.
<p>

You can immediately set up some user preferences; here are some useful
ones: You'll probably want to set up your account to jump immediately to
the ontology editor as opposed to other services offered by
www-ksl-svc. The preferences page is alphabetical, so "service, jump
straight to" is toward the bottom.
<p>

Another good preference is "Library: show only session-accesible ontologies
in the header". This will put the InterMed ontologies (plus any you might
create) at the top of the ontology library page.
<p>

Once you are in the InterMed group (which shouldn't take more than a day),
then when you log in, you should select the option of logging in with
"group ownership" as intermed. You will also have the option of connecting
to any already existing intermed sessions. If there are any such sessions,
you should connect to them, as these sessions may have some our ontologies
pre-loaded.  <p>

Warning: Some InterMed ontologies are quite large. Beware of Loinc-orig,
this is the largest we currently have and it may take 5-10 minutes to load. 
<p>

A useful feature: When you are looking at an ontology page, a preferred way
to look at the concepts is via the "browse" pages, or better yet, via
"focused browse". The former gives you an indented hierarchy display, and
the latter gives you just a small piece of that class hierarchy. (If you
are looking at a single class, you can jump to the focused browse page for
that class, showing you the siblings and parent(s) of the class.)
<p>

Reminder: This is an editor, not just a browser -- you will be able to
actually modify and/or annotate concepts or ontologies. Don't forget to
save changes, if you want them to be recorded.
<p>
    
Have fun!
