<hr>
Welcome to <b>Stanford Section on Medical Informatics</b>'s T-Helper system. The T-HELPER system is a graphical medical record and decision-support system for health-care workers to use in caring for AIDS patients to encourage enrollment in and compliance with protocol-based therapy. This experimental Web interface brings to the Internet the part of the T-Helper system that checks the eligibility of patients for AIDS clinical trials. This interface allows you to enter pertinent patient information and see if the data are consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the clinical trials that the T-Helper system supports. In addition, certain portions of the protocols are available on-line for you to browse. Because this Web-based interface is only a prototype, and because of drug companies' confidentiality concerns, only a small number of protocols are available here.
