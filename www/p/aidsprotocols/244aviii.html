INFORMED CONSENT:<p>
<p>
Because you are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), you are
invited to volunteer for the research study named above.  This study is a
clinical trial of a three drug combination.  Before you can decide whether or
not to volunteer for this study, you must understand the purpose, how it may
help you, any risks to you, and what is expected of you.  This process is
called informed consent.<p>
<p>
YOUR RIGHTS:<p>
<p>
This consent form gives you information about the study which will be discussed
with you.  Once you understand the study, and if you agree to participate, you
will be asked to sign this consent form.  You will be given a copy to keep.
Before you learn about the study, it is important that you know the
following:<p>
<p>
o	Your participation is entirely voluntary<p>
o	You may decide not to participate or withdraw from the study at any time
without penalty.<p>
<p>
PURPOSE OF STUDY:<p>
<p>
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that slowly destroys the body's
immune system (ability to fight disease).  When a person becomes infected with
HIV, he/she has HIV disease.  As the immune system is destroyed by HIV, the
person may move either slowly or quickly from having no signs of illness to
advanced disease and AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
A person infected with HIV is said to have AIDS when he/she becomes ill with
one or more of a long list of diseases caused by common microorganisms that
would not make un-infected people sick.  These illnesses are called
"opportunistic infections" or "OIs".  People with AIDS also have a low number
of CD4 cells (white blood cells that help the immune system fight infection).<p>
<p>
This is a phase II, blinded, randomized trial, meaning you will be given a
combination of drugs in which you will have a one in three chance (similar to
selection by the toss of a coin) of receiving a combination of (1) zidovudine +
inactive ddI + inactive nevirapine, or (2) zidovudine + ddI + inactive
nevirapine, or (3) zidovudine + ddI + nevirapine.  Neither you, your doctor nor
the doctor's staff will know what drugs you are taking.<p>
<p>
The drug zidovudine (ZDV) is approved for the treatment of HIV-infected
patients with CD4 (immune system helper T) cell counts less than 500
cells/mm^3.  Despite the fact that ZDV has been shown to prolong survival and
delay progression to AIDS, patients treated with ZDV continue to develop
opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection.  Another
drug called didanosine (ddI) has been approved for the treatment of patients
with advanced HIV infection who have failed or cannot tolerate ZDV.  There is
increasing evidence that long-term treatment with one drug, such as ZDV, may
cause the virus to become resistant, raising concerns that HIV-infected
patients may not continue to benefit from such treatment.<p>
<p>
Laboratory studies suggest that treatment with ZDV, ddI and other
antiretrovirals may be useful.  Studies of combinations of drugs are currently
taking place to determine if combination therapy can prevent the virus from
becoming resistant and is better for patients.  Results are not yet available
from ongoing two-drug combination studies, so we are uncertain if the
combination of ZDV and didanosine (ddI) is more effective than if these drugs
are taken alone.  It appears that patients seem to tolerate the two-drug
combination with few side effects although this drug combination has been
tested to date in only a limited number of patients with advanced HIV
infection.<p>
<p>
Nevirapine is an investigational drug that has been studied in the laboratory
and has been used in preliminary trials in patients with HIV infection.  In
these studies, nevirapine has been given alone and in combination with ZDV and
seems to be well-tolerated.  A regimen of three drugs (ZDV, didanosine (ddI)
and nevirapine) was more effective than other two-drug combinations in
laboratory experiments.  These experiments suggest that HIV is less able to
develop resistance to nevirapine if it had already developed resistance to ZDV
and didanosine (ddI) in the test-tube.  Studies are now underway with this
three drug combination in a small number of patients.  This study is designed
to find out if the addition of nevirapine to the combination of ZDV and ddI is
safe and effective for patients with HIV infection.<p>
<p>
The purposes of this research project are as follows:  a) to validate (prove)
that a specific change (genetic mutation at codon 215 of reverse transcriptase)
in a patient's virus (HIV) appears in the blood before the amount of virus in
the blood increases and T4 cells decrease, as has been observed in association
with clinical failure on ZDV:  b) to determine whether patients on ZDV alone
that develop this mutation (codon 215 by RNA PCR) change the amount of virus in
the blood and the number of T4 cells when given a combination of other anti-HIV
drugs (ddI, Nevirapine).<p>
<p>
PROCEDURES:<p>
<p>
In order to qualify, you must have been taking at least 300 mg/day of ZDV for
more than one month, but less than two years and have a negative test for codon
215.  There will be three evaluations before starting the study.  During these
evaluations blood samples will be taken to determine whether or not you qualify
for the protocol.  If you are selected to participate, you will begin taking
ZDV two 100 mg capsules 3 times per day, with ddI placebo (inactive substance)
twice a day, and nevirapine placebo twice a day.  You will receive medication
at the first study visit and then medication will be dispensed at the end of
week 4 and then every 8 weeks thereafter.  You will return for a study visit
and to have your blood drawn every 8 weeks.  At screening, the amount of blood
drawn is approximately 75cc (5 tablespoons).  At baseline, the amount of blood
drawn is approximately 60cc (4 tablespoons).  At day 0, the amount of blood
drawn is approximately 27cc (less than 2 tablespoons).  The procedures done at
week 8 and 16 will require approximately 35cc (a little more than 2
tablespoons) and 75cc (5 tablespoons) respectively, and these procedures will
be repeated every 8 or 16 weeks according to the study schedule.  The maximum
amount of blood that will be drawn at any one time will be 130cc (about 9 table
spoons).<p>
<p>
If your virus develops a mutation at codon 215 (change in the genetic code of
the virus, believed to mean that the virus is resistant to ZDV) you will be
assigned at random to one of the following categories:  1) continue ZDV (as
previously) plus ddI placebo (as previously) plus Nevirapine placebo (as
previously); 2) ZDV 100 mg, 2 capsules three times a day plus ddI 200 mg twice
daily plus nevirapine placebo twice daily; or 3) ZDV 100 mg, 2 capsules three times a
day plus ddI 200 mg twice daily plus nevirapine 100 mg twice daily, after 8
weeks nevirapine will be increased to 200 mg twice daily.  If you weigh less
than 60 kilograms [original text reads "pounds"], you will receive a reduced
daily dose of ddI.  ddI must be taken on an empty stomach and at least 2 hours
apart from other medications, including nevirapine.  The experimental
medications may be adjusted by the investigator if you develop side effects.<p>
<p>
Neither the investigator nor you will be notified when you develop the 215
codon mutation, or when your medication is changed by a random method, or which
medications you are taking.  You will be followed for up to 4 years if you
remain in the study.  At the end of your time in the study, at the physician's
discretion, you may be offered non-blinded therapies.<p>
<p>
The experimental part of this research is the use of the mutation at codon 215
(change in the genetic code of the virus) as a marker for the change in
therapy.  Although the presence of this mutation is associated with resistance
of the virus to ZDV in the test tube, the clinical significance of this has not
been established.<p>
<p>
A total of 300 subjects are expected to participate in this research project.<p>
<p>
RISKS, INCONVENIENCES AND DISCOMFORTS<p>
<p>
The major risk associated with participation in this study is in receiving a
new drug combination that has had limited use in people.  The major side
effects of didanosine (ddI) are peripheral neuropathy (pain in the feet or
hands) due to nerve damage and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).<p>
<p>
The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include tingling, burning, pain or
numbness in the feet or hands.  The symptoms of pancreatitis may include
stomach or abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  If you experience any of these
symptoms, you should call your physician immediately.  Didanosine (ddI) also
may cause diarrhea, headache and inflammation of the liver (hepatitis).<p>
<p>
The side effects in humans of zidovudine include a decrease of red blood cells
(anemia), which may be serious enough to require blood transfusions.  Other
side effects that have been reported include headaches, muscle aches, nausea,
vomiting, fever, skin rashes and sleeplessness.  A lowered white blood cell
count (neutropenia) has also been reported.  In general, these side effects are
reversible after the drug is discontinued.<p>
<p>
The side effects to blood draws are:  discomfort, bleeding or bruising where
the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting or infection. <p>
<p>
The side effects in humans of nevirapine include skin rash, fever, and
possibly, increased liver function tests (including bilirubin, AST and ALT).
Mild sleeplessness has also been reported.  Unanticipated side effects may
occur from the combination of these drug regimens.  If any unusual symptoms or
changes occur, you should call your study physician immediately.<p>
<p>
Although no genetic abnormalities have been observed in people, patients who
engage in heterosexual intercourse are advised to use a reliable method of
birth control during the study and for 3 months after completion of therapy.<p>
<p>
PREGNANCY<p>
<p>
Pregnant and nursing women will be excluded from this protocol.  All women of
childbearing age will have a pregnancy test performed and evaluated before
entry into the study.  You are advised that while no information exists
regarding the interaction of NVP and oral contraceptives (the Pill), it is
possible that this combination decreases the effectiveness of oral
contraceptives.  It is strongly suggested that you use an additional and/or
alternative form of birth control while participating in this study.  If you
become pregnant while taking study medications, you must tell your [original
text reads "my"] study doctor immediately.  You will be withdrawn from the
study until the child is delivered or the pregnancy is terminated.<p>
<p>
Interactions with other drugs used in the treatment of patients with AIDS are
also incompletely studied.  If you are eligible and decide to participate in
this study, you should not take other medications without first talking with
your [original text reads "my"] study doctor.<p>
<p>
Frequently scheduled physical examinations, including blood tests, will be
performed to detect any possible side effects during the course of the study.
<p>
<p>
POSSIBLE BENEFITS TO YOU OR OTHERS:<p>
<p>
The possible benefits to you may include the following:  prevention or delay in
the onset of infections or cancers which are commonly seen in patients with HIV
infection; improvement in symptoms associated with HIV infection, such as night
sweats, diarrhea, and weight loss; improvement of your immune function (how
your body fights infection), and possibly slows the growth of HIV in your body.
These drugs are not expected to produce a cure of your HIV infection.<p>
<p>
Participation in this study may show that when a patient develops the 215 codon
mutation, the individual may also have developed drug resistance, and that
changing the medication may have an [original text reads "any"] effect on the
disease, but no guarantee can be made.<p>
<p>
It cannot be guaranteed that you will receive any benefits from this study.
Benefits to others may include the understanding of the safety and
effectiveness of combination therapies in the treatment of patients with HIV
infection.<p>
<p>
SAFEGUARDS<p>
