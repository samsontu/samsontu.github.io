The InterMed Collaboratory</h2>


<hr>
<p>InterMed began (on May 1, 1994), as a collaboration among the <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu" target="_self">Stanford
Medical Informatics</a> (SMI) at Stanford University, the <a href="http://dsg.harvard.edu/public/intermed/InterMed_Collab.html" target="_self">Decision
Systems Group</a> (DSG) at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and the
<a href="http://www.cpmc.columbia.edu/" target="_self">Department
of Medical Informatics </a>at Columbia University. Researchers in the Laboratory
of Computer Science at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the
Center
for Medical Education at McGill University became closely involved at later
dates. One of the central objectives of InterMed has been to develop sets
of tools and resources for disseminating clinical guidelines across medical
disciplines and settings. The development of the <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/intermed-web/guidelines/GLIF1.htm" target="_self">GuideLine
Interchange Language</a> (GLIF 2.0), a computer-based format that can be
used to distribute guidelines across different institutions and systems
has been the primary product of this undertaking. More about InterMed,
1994-1998 can be found <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/intermed-web/Old/Old.htm" target="_self">here</a>.
<p>Since June 1999, the InterMed collaboratory, now including the <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu" target="_self">Stanford
Medical Informatics</a> (SMI) at Stanford University, the <a href="http://dsg.harvard.edu/public/intermed/InterMed_Collab.html" target="_self">Decision
Systems Group</a> at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and the <a href="http://www.cpmc.columbia.edu/" target="_self">Department
of Medical Informatics</a> at Columbia University, has been working on
the development of the new version of GLIF, called <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/intermed-web/guidelines/GLIF1.htm" target="_self">GLIF
3.0</a>
<p>The funding of the InterMed project has ended on December 2003, but
the research on GLIF and its implementation will continue. One route by
which research on GLIF will continue is through the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/">HL7
Clinical Guidelines Special Interest Group</a>.

<h2>
Background</h2>
Recent tends in health care delivery have led to an increase emphasis on
the development of guidelines for prevention, diagnosis work-up, treatment,
and patient-management processes (clinical pathways). Such guidelines are
motivated by concerns about marked variation in clinical practice and are
designed to help to provide a common standard care both within a health
care organization and among different organizations. Because the guidelines
can be complex and often are designed for use where several levels of providers
are working together to take optimal care of patients, researchers have
sought methods of computer-aided support of the administration of such
guidelines. Significant work is required to put the guidelines, typically
created as text documents, into a useful format to support this computer
assistance. Much of the work is related to resolving ambiguities in the
paper versions of the documents. Another approach,m providing computer-based
authoring environments, solves some of the problems, but highlights the
need for an accepted standard for the computer-based representation of
these guidelines and the way in which they are to be used. Thus a guideline
converted to a computer-based representation at one institution is typically
unusable by the clinical information systems at other organizations. A
significant goal of our proposed research is to develop a common standard
which will allow for the computer-based representation of a guideline at
one institution, and its storage on a central server on the Internet. The
purpose is to provide the ability to have the content of the guideline
made available either to provide direct execution of guidelines in response
to network-based queries or to serve as a repository of standardized, encoded
guidelines that may be downloaded, translated and used as part of computer-based
patient record system at institutions beyond the site at which they were
originally encoded.
<p>The primary product of the InterMed Collaboratory in the years 1994-1998
was the <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/intermed-web/guidelines/GLIF1.htm" target="_self">GLIF</a>
language for sharing computer representations of guidelines. We have found
that the process of encoding guidelines in the GLIF language discovers
ambiguities in the documents which can in turn be fed back to the guideline's
creators. This research proposal defines a set if steps for extending the
expressiveness of the GLIF language and for developing methods to translate
GLIF into local execution languages, such as the Arden Syntax.
<h2>
Research Tasks</h2>
In response to the motivations described in the previous section, we seek
to address the following specific aims:
<p>1) Extending the GLIF language for representing the description of guideline
knowledge. GLIF 2.0 supports the description of the relationships among
different steps in the guideline. The primary extension are to create standard
descriptions of the steps themselves and to have a well-defined meaning
associated with each of the recommended actions in order to aid in the
copmuter-based execution of the guideline.
<p>2) Examining, characterizing, and encoding representative guidelines.
We will use a subset of the ACP-developed guidelines along with federally
developed guidelines for our testbed. The encoded guidelines will become
available as part of the guideline server, described below.
<p>3) Creating a guideline server (accessible over the Internet) that can
provide support for distributing and sharing encoded versions of guidelines.
The server will allow: (a) browsing the encoded guidelines using viewing
tools (adapted from PROTEGE and GEODE).; (b) accessing text versions of
the guidelines; (c) computing eligibility criteria for guidelines and execution
of some categories of protocols; (d) downloading guidelines in GLIF format;
and (e) request information about other individuals or organizations which
are utilizing the same guidelines. We will also produce a set of Application
Program Interfaces (APIs) to allow network-based applications to have remote
access to capabilities of the server. Program access to the server's execution
model requires that a communication protocol be worked out for getting
data elements from the remote program to the server and for transferring
advice back from the server to the remote site. In some cases, it will
not be possible to obtain sufficient data to make definite decision at
the server, and thus the server must be able to specify conditional information
back to the remote site for evaluation by the user.
<p>4) Extending guideline-encoding and viewing tools: providing syntax
checkers to ensure guideline integrity and semantic checkers (writing programs
that will validate a GLIF3 specification of a guideline: for example, (a)
answer reachability problems (is node B reachable from node A); (b) trying
to find deadlock situations, or missing "elses" (a branch with only one
branch destination, a decision with only one next step); and (c) if the
guideline contains a branch criterion that utilizes certain data elements,
the checker can make sure that branch criteria are not redundant, or result
in situations where the logic of the criteria prohibits traversal to certain
parts of the guideline. Ted also mentions an integrity checker, but does
not explain what he means.
<p>5) Developing methods for turning the GLIF representation into an executable
guideline representation for application by the central guideline server
in response to remote-procedure calls over the Internet.
<p>6) Developing tools for generating explanations of recommendations
<p>7) Studying cognitive aspects of creating guidelines, of the encoding
tasks described above, and of the clinical use of guidelines in computer-assisted
environments. The results of these studies will provide feedback to the
ACP and other organizations about ways to improve guideline design and
provide better understanding about problems that can occur as the textual
format of the guidelines are turned into the structured representations
needed for online storage and execution.
