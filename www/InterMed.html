<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>


The rapid proliferation of new biomedical knowledge coupled with


an increasing need to use limited resources more efficiently has


presented unique and formidable challenges to the domain of medicine.


It is widely recognized that technological change is an integral


part of the solution for the clinical, educational, and research


issues that confront the discipline. Medical informatics can be


viewed as both an applied discipline concerned with adapting and


optimizing technology for the delivery of safe and effective health


care, and as a basic science which addresses fundamental issues


at the interface between computer science, informationand communication


science, medical tasks, and human behavior [Greenes &amp; Shortliffe,


1990]. In this latter respect, it provides the theoretical and


scientific basis for medical computing and medical information


systems [Lindberg, 1986]. 


<p>


We report here on a multi-institutional project inspired by recommendations


in a 1993 report on national collaboratories from the Computer


Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Research


Council (NRC) [Committee on a National Collaboratory &amp; Computer


Science and Telecommunications Board (National Research Council),


1993]. The preface of that report succinctly defines the notion


on which we have built our work: &quot;A national collaboratory


is a center without walls, in which the nation's researchers can


perform their research without regard to geographical location-interacting


with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational


resources, [and] accessing information in digital libraries....


[Such a collaboratory is] more than a mere interconnection of


computers [and offers] a complete infrastructure of software,


hardware, and networked resources to enable a full range of collaborative


work among scientists.&quot; Taking advantage of the rapid change


in computing and communications technologies, the InterMed project


seeks to demonstrate the viability of the collaboratory concept


in the context of medical informatics research. InterMed was initiated


as a collaboration among the Stanford informatics community, the


Harvard Decision Systems Group (DSG), and the Columbia Presbyterian


Medical Center (CPMC). Workers at Massachusetts General Hospital,


the University of Utah, and McGill University are also closely


involved. The broad project goal is to use the power of the Internet


to support the following aims:


<ul>


<li>To accelerate our individual progress in building advanced


clinical, educational, and research applications using software


and information components made available by our collaborators;


<li>To build new biomedical and clinical applications using shared


components and methodologies;


<li>To provide a broadly applicable model for such collaborative


work;


<li>To evaluate the collaboratory activities with a variety of


functional, cognitive, and observational metrics. 


</ul>






<p>


We are accordingly addressing a central issue identified in the


NRC's report: &quot;The proposed collaboratory testbed program


is consonant with the objectives of the High Performance Computing


and Communications (HPCC) Initiative. ... Many components of HPCC,


such as research into medical computation and environmental computation,


access to academic medical centers and environmental databases,


prototyping of experimental high-performance computing systems,


research into software tools, and computer access in general will


require collaboration between scientists and technologists.&quot;


We envision our efforts as precursors to a national (or international)


collaboratory with many more participants.






<h2>Motivation</h2>


<p>


The emergence of advanced networking capabilities under the High


Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative makes


it feasible to consider <i>component-based architecture</i>s for


computer-based applications. Such architectures are highly desirable


because they leverage the efforts of multiple participants (potentially


at multiple sites), allow reuse of components, foster emergence


of standards, permit integration of services from multiple platforms,


and provide a mechanism for evolution of older, more monolithic


(&quot;legacy&quot;) systems.


<p>


Such capabilities are of particular importance in the healthcare


marketplace, where systems are exceedingly complex, must serve


multiple purposes, and must respond to the economic pressures


that are forcing examination of ways to be more cost-effective.


Yet traditional systems for the healthcare marketplace are primarily


of a legacy nature and are poorly positioned to provide the architectural


infrastructure needed. Using collaborative methodologies, we are


seeking to develop a suite of capabilities, and communication


protocols by which they can be used, such that any compliant workstation


or central computer application can incorporate them. We seek


to provide an architecture for evolution and expansion of capabilities


in a component-based fashion that leverages the work of multiple


independent developers. The approach should make the construction


of applications more effective by allowing developers to focus


on the flow and integration of information and not on the details


of the underlying components.


<p>


We and others in the medical informatics community have recognized


that the professional healthcare worker must be able to have access


to a variety of resources in a problem-specific manner, and that


those resources do not exist in a single system or on a single


platform, but rather must be assembled as needed [Greenes &amp;


Shortliffe, 1990; Puerta, Tu &amp; Musen, 1993]. Thus we envision


workstations that will serve as the integrating mechanism for


identifying the need for resources, gathering them together from


disparate networked locations, and incorporating them into an


integrated environment.


<p>


There has been a growing recognition of the impossibility of having


any single system incorporate all desirable capabilities without


a tremendous developmental burden, expense, and duplication of


effort. Thus there has been great emphasis recently on the notion


of modular system construction, domain-specific software architectures


(DSSA) [Hufnagel, Harbison, Silva &amp; Metalla, 1994], and the


development of standards that will permit data sharing and software


integration. Information technology experts in the healthcare


arena now routinely identify the need to provide facile linkages


among hospital information systems, imaging systems, departmental


systems, external databases and knowledge bases, and similar components-all


requiring a consistent taxonomy of concepts and well-articulated


descriptions of components and how they must interact. 


<p>


Advanced computing and communications capabilities, such as those


being emphasized under the HPCC initiative, offer great hope for


distributing system capabilities over high-speed networks while


introducing new technologies for multimedia, video conferencing,


and specialized computing (such as parallel search and 3-D modeling).


Anticipating the rapid change in computing power and communications


that is imminent, we are working to demonstrate the viability


of the collaboratory concept as well as the component-based architectures


that we believe will increasingly become the only practical way


to construct large, complex software systems. 






<h2>Collaborative architecture</h2>


<p>


The model on which we have built our collaboration involves the


decomposition of current development activities into sets of components


that can be constructed at one or more institutions, shared with


others, and then melded to provide robust applications that could


not be developed as effectively by any single group. 


<p>


We have developed a model composed of 7 tiers (Figure 1), each


of which supports the levels above it: 


<ol>


<li><i>Infrastructure and Services:</i> The network itself, plus


the associated systems methodologies; 


<li><i>Vocabulary/Taxonomy:</i> The vocabularies needed to support


components and applications; 


<li><i>Data and Knowledge:</i> The databases and knowledge bases


on which clinical applications are built; 


<li><i>Agents and Components:</i> The elements that build on Tiers


1 through 3 and support modular construction of clinical systems;






<li><i>Composition/Development Environments:</i> The application


frameworks and development tools that depend on the components


and agents while providing for creation of applications; 


<li><i>Testbed Applications:</i> Applications to support clinical


care, education, and decision making; and 


<li><i>Collaborative Policies:</i> The policies, principles, and


guidelines (regarding ownership, liability, intellectual property,


confidentiality, security, and the like) that must be developed


and implemented in defining models by which applications are constructed,


and software is shared, across communication networks. 


</ol>






<p>


Our work has been facilitated through the use of e-mail, file


servers, World Wide Web (WWW) browsers, Internet-based applications


of many sorts, and conferencing tools such as Timbuktu and phone


conferences. In the initial years we have focused in particular


on the construction of shared models and representations for clinical


vocabularies and clinical guidelines (Tiers 2 and 3). Those shared


models are being implemented on servers that are accessible via


the Internet. Some early experiments at the higher tiers are also


briefly described below.


<p>


<img SRC="InterMed1.gif" WIDTH="556" HEIGHT="282"><br>


Figure 1. Seven-Tiered Collaborative Architecture


<p>


The seven-tiered collaborative model resulted from extensive discussions


among members of our groups who have sought to identify a useful


organizational structure for explaining our interrelated activities.


This tiered model is perhaps best understood in the context of


evolving notions of <i>middleware</i> that have been extensively


discussed in the computer-science and telecommunications communities


[Korzeniowski, 1993]. For the Internet today, there is an underlying,


readily available, infrastructure which consists of elements such


as networks, servers, gateways, network-aware operating systems,


protocol suites, and information services. On top of this infrastructure,


people build various stand-alone applications-some general and


some for particular domains-all essentially from scratch. These


vertically-oriented application systems require a great deal of


custom-tailored development effort.


<p>


We (and many others who are concerned about the complexity of


software development, the time required to field new applications,


and the failure to benefit from the experiences of others except


through published articles) support ongoing efforts to develop


additional middleware layers that need to be added to the network's


architecture. There are at least two kinds of such middleware


under development: <i>general</i> middleware (sitting atop the


existing infrastructure and providing new kinds of services across


application domains) and <i>domain-specific</i> middleware. Thus


we seek to develop a layer of tools and services that cater to


the domain-specific needs of biomedical applications (<i>biomedical</i>


middleware) and that facilitate the development of more horizontally


integrated workstation environments for medical professionals.






<h3>Vocabulary server (tier 2)</h3>


<p>


During the first two years of InterMed work, much of the emphasis


has been placed on developing a shared view of how a generic clinical


vocabulary should be structured [Oliver, 1995]. Representatives


from all sites began by investigating representation tools to


support developing, browsing, and modifying vocabulary knowledge


structures. They surveyed the InterMed sites to focus the collaborative


vocabulary server work on specific application goals stimulated


by ongoing projects at the various institutions. Using an available


Web-based knowledge-representation tool known as Ontolingua [Farquhar,


Fikes, Pratt &amp; Rice, 1995], team members from Stanford have


adapted an Ontolingua WWW-based vocabulary editing tool for collaborative


use among the InterMed project members [Gennari, Oliver, Pratt,


Rice &amp; Musen, 1995; Rice, Farquhar, Piernot &amp; Gruber,


1996]. The editor has two immediate benefits: (1) because it is


Web-based, it is hardware independent and usable on any machine


that can run standard Web browsers, thus permitting ready access


by collaborators at the other InterMed sites, and (2) it shields


developers from the syntactic details of the Ontolingua language,


allowing editing of the vocabulary content without requiring knowledge


of Ontolingua (or even a local installation of Ontolingua). A


software tool automatically generates Hypertext Markup Language


(HTML) pages from Ontolingua and is used to update WWW pages which


sit on a server at Stanford as workers at Columbia or Harvard


add to the content of the vocabulary. 


<p>

Figure 2. Development of a Collaborative Model for a Clinical


Vocabulary


<p>


Based on our early work, and guided by intense study of each other's


vocabulary conventions, by the summer of 1995 we had defined a


process for developing a shared vocabulary model as is shown in


Figure 2. We were influenced by the major terminology effort coordinated


by the National Library of Medicine (the Unified Medical Language


System, or UMLS, with which several InterMed collaborators had


also been involved as developers). We also sought to understand


overlapping and conflicting needs and features of clinical vocabularies


that were in use at the various sites. These included SNOMED,


which had been studied extensively and adopted in part by many


of us, but also the Medical Entities Dictionary (MED) which is


in use at Columbia (InterMed researchers identified a sharable


subset of Columbia's MED, dubbed &quot;InterMED,&quot; which was


converted to Ontolingua format and loaded on a server at Stanford),


the LOINC system (a national development effort with which the


University of Utah has been closely involved), the IVORY vocabulary


(which evolved from Wisconsin's WARP terminology and has been


used for the T-HELPER AIDS management project at Stanford), and


Thenetsys vocabulary in use at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Guided


by an analysis of the input/output characteristics that would


be required by a network-based server if it were to meet the needs


of our various application projects, as well as the associated


browsing/maintenance requirements, we sought to develop a generic,


implementation-independent vocabulary model which used a set of


&quot;meta descriptors&quot; to define semantic elements that


need to be represented [Oliver, 1995]. Using this model, which


continues to evolve as we learn more about each other's work and


requirements, an implementation has been created using the Ontolingua


server mentioned above [Oliver et al., 1995]. Our goal is to demonstrate


that the server can in turn provide the basis for mapping sub-vocabularies,


represented using the generic model, back into the local vocabularies


that we require for specific applications at our individual sites.


In this way, future vocabulary-development efforts, at our institutions


and elsewhere, may be able to draw on the generic model and server


as they are fleshed out with additional content (see discussion


below regarding recent applications work at the higher tiers).


The effort is not meant to duplicate or compete with existing


vocabulary efforts but, rather, to provide a generic model for


how they can be related to one another, with the UMLS playing


a key lookup role as the master thesaurus. 






<h2>Collaborative model development (tiers 2 and 3)</h2>


<p>


As we gained insight into the process by which we were evolving


a shared view of the vocabulary server's role and representation


requirements, we attempted to abstract the process, defining an


approach to &quot;collaborative model development&quot; which


we hoped would apply to other multi-institutional group development


activities (Figure 3). More recently we have linked the vocabulary


development work (Tier 2) to the generation of a shared model


for clinical guideline representation and use (Tier 3), recognizing


that a set of applications related to guidelines would be extremely


helpful in testing/evaluating the relevant facilities of our vocabulary


server while providing the focusing power of specific performance


expectations. All InterMed sites are working locally on guidelines


development and integration of guidelines into clinical systems.


Through extensive discussion and email exchanges, we have begun


to identify the common characteristics as well as methods for


resolving some of the apparent central differences among the approaches.


We are applying our generic approach for collaborative model development


to the notion of a network-based guidelines server [Pattison-Gordon


et al., 1996]. Early experiments at sharing such guidelines in


applications developed at the higher tiers are also underway (see


next section).


<p>


<img SRC="InterMed3.gif" WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="247"><br>


Figure 3. Generic Approach to Collaborative Model Development






<h2>Applications built from shared components (tiers, 4, 5, and


6)</h2>


<p>


As was mentioned earlier, our goal is to develop sharable components


and resources at the lower tiers of our collaborative model and


to use them for site-specific applications. We have described


early examples of this approach, and further such developments


are ongoing. For example, in one experiment, a successful mapping


has been achieved between part of the clinical laboratory test


vocabulary at Columbia and the diagostic findings vocabulary of


MGH's DXplain program [Barnett, Cimino, Hupp &amp; Hoffer, 1987].


By having the common vocabulary model, we have been able to automate


the transfer of patient data directly into DXplain from Columbia


to generate differential diagnoses for patients at Columbia from


within that institution's clinical data management environment


[Elhanan, Socratous &amp; Cimino, 1996]. This effort required


not only the development of shared vocabulary conventions but


also collaborative agreements between Columbia and MGH on interface


conventions for sending patient descriptors to DXplain over the


Internet and receiving differential diagnosis information for


display to clinicians at Columbia. In another experiment, InterMed


collaborators have developed a cholesterol guideline program which


can be integrated into Web-based clinical applications at other


sites by passing patient information as parameters over the Net


(age, sex, cholesterol, diagoses, etc.). The vocabulary server


supports the specification of patient data which need to be expressed


using a controlled terminology, such as diagnoses and risk factors


[Cimino, Socratous &amp; Clayton, 1995]. In yet another development


effort, we have explored the use of the Web as a mechanism for


supporting searching of the Medline literature database, developing


a Web-based server that translates user requests into calls into


a Medline server at the University of California [Detmer &amp;


Shortliffe, 1995].






<h2>Mechanisms for collaboration</h2>


<p>


One of the goals of the InterMed project has been to use advanced


collaborative communications technologies and, in turn, to assess


the strengths and limitations of network-mediated collaboration.


Throughout the project, collaborators have been in almost daily


contact, largely via electronic mail, and our online email archives


are extensive. The archives also provide a detailed record of


both the form and content of the joint design and development


activities that have been assumed under the InterMed umbrella.


<p>


Despite the power and utility of electronic mail, we learned early


in the collaboration that it has some serious limitations for


the kind of joint research that we are pursuing. In particular,


e-mail's narrow bandwidth is more than adequate for communication


among individuals who know each other well and have shared perceptions


of the problems on which they are jointly working. To try to address


this issue, we have initiated occasional face-to-face meetings


during national meetings or when members of one institution have


visited groups at other institutions to see their systems in operation,


to examine data structures in detail, and to get a much stronger


understanding of how the developing shared resources need to be


configured in order to meet the broad requirements of the InterMed


community. After these visits, the e-mail communication among


the groups has become more concrete and effective.


<p>


In addition, teleconferencing (rather than video-conferencing,


which proved expensive via commercial links and technically inadequate


via Internet video-link software such as CUSeeMe) has been enthusiastically


accepted. We hold conference calls for 90 minutes every two weeks,


involving essentially all project members at all six sites. The


addition of McGill cognitive scientists has added an new dimension


to the collaborative work. The McGill team largely listens (and


records for later transcription) during the conference calls,


viewing the discussions as experimental material for analysis


as we attempt to measure and evaluate the collaborative process


(see below). 


<p>


In preparation for a 1995 InterMed demonstration session [Oliver


et al., 1995], we needed to coordinate contributions from each


of the collaborative sites. This required extensive e-mail exchanges


but also &quot;distributed group meetings&quot; at which we were


able to practice talks, show planned slides, and demonstrate software


to one another. To support demonstrations, we experimented with


Timbuktu, a cross-platform software tool that allowed machines


at each site, hooked up to projection devices, to be linked over


the Internet. One machine would &quot;drive&quot; the displays


on all linked machines, thereby allowing each site to run its


own demo while the researchers at the other sites observed and


commented. This software provides useful additional support for


the kinds of collaborative processes with which we are experimenting.






<h2>Evaluation process</h2>


<p>


The Internet is well established as a tool for collaborative research


in areas such as nuclear physics and biotechnology. With its increasing


role in medicine, it has been natural for the Internet to become


a tool for collaborative medical informatics research. We seek


to understand which aspects are successful and which fail. With


special cognitive evaluation expertise provided by the Centre


for Medical Education at McGill University, we seek to evaluate


the InterMed collaboration using two complementary approaches.


The first is a formative evaluation, in which we will evaluate


InterMed's success in attaining its stated objectives. We will


be guided by the specific aims defined in the original InterMed


proposal and in subsequent documents as the project has evolved.


The second evaluation focuses on more fundamental research issues,


assessing InterMed as an ongoing experiment in computer-mediated


collaborative design. We seek to understand this design process,


and the role of the Internet as a medium for such an endeavor.


The two sets of objectives are interdependent, and the second


will provide a basis for developing and continually refining guidelines


for formal evaluation of both our work and work by others. The


analytic framework will also facilitate contributions to the iterative


design-implementation-evaluation process. Early results of this


evaluation work have been reported elsewhere [Patel, Cimino &amp;


Shortliffe, 1996].


<p>


The theoretical and methodological framework is guided by three


research paradigms: 1) design as a problem-solving process; 2)


collaboration as a process of distributed cognition and collective


intelligence, and 3) computer-mediated cognition in which external


representations in the form of artifacts play an essential role


in continuously shaping all facets of the design and communication


processes. We view &quot;design&quot; not merely as end-state


planning process, but as an ongoing continuous process, which


is an integral part of all research and development activity.


In important respects, informatics is part of an emerging science


of design [Simon, 1981]. Design is concerned with devising artifacts


to obtain specific goals. The process of design is more commonly


thought of as part of an applied domain, perhaps involving the


application of scientific principles. In practice, design is strongly


bound by domain-specific constraints, and grounded in the contexts


in which an artifact is to be used. However, it may be advantageous


to conceive of design as a &quot;science of the artificial&quot;


[Simon, 1981] or a local science [diSessa, 1993]. This is a science


which unlike natural sciences, is not approximately reducible


to fundamental principles, yet is guided by more abstract principles


concerned with function and adaptation. In this respect, design


is not merely the product of applying principles from other domains


of science, rather it occupies a more central role in developing


and testing of scientific theories. Conceived in this way, we


can capitalize on the invariant properties of the scientific design


process. We can draw important parallels to research on scientific


reasoning in the social context [Patel, Dunbar &amp; Kaufman,


1995; Patel, Kaufman &amp; Magder, in press].


<p>


In recent years, the process of design has been the object of


psychological and cognitive science research [Goel &amp; Pirolli,


1992; Norman, 1993] in both its guise as a scientific enterprise


and as an applied discipline. We can characterize the process


of design as a problem-solving process. In this respect, we can


bring to bear theoretical and methodological tools to analyze


and evaluate the process and products of design in terms of <i>representations</i>,


<i>problem spaces</i>, and <i>task environments</i>. Design in


medical informatics has unique characteristics which can be specified


in terms of objectives, tasks, and task environments. 


<p>


One of the innovative aspects of InterMed is that it is an ongoing


collaborative design process. The collaborative activities are


centered at different sites spread across vast geographical distances.


The principal means of collaboration is through various electronic


Internet-based media. The objectives can be construed as a collaborative


distributed problem-solving process. Collaboration carries with


it the expectation of a singular purpose and a seamless integration


of the parts, given the appearance of unified whole [Smith, 1994].


To achieve that singular purpose, there is need to achieve a high


level of coherence and shared mental models among participants.


Mental model is a construct that describes how individuals form


internal models of systems during interaction [Norman, 1983].


An individual's mental models provide predictive and explanatory


capabilities of the function of a given system. Shared mental


models refer to organized knowledge shared by team members. [Orasanu


&amp; Salas, 1993] The extent to which a group has a coherent


shared mental model has been shown to affect the level of performance


in collaborative activities such as flight navigation.


<p>


Evaluating a collaborative design process necessitates an analytic


framework for understanding how the various activities lead to


constructing distributed representations, task environments, problem


spaces, and cognitive strategies. Another distinguishing characteristic


of InterMed is that it is a computer-mediated collaborative process.


The notion of mediated implies that it is not merely an instrument


to achieve an end-product, but as a vehicle of thought and an


integral component of the distributed cognitive task, that profoundly


shapes the process of collaboration. To study a distributed cognitive


task it is necessary to decompose the representation of the task


into its internal and external components so that different functions


of internal and external representations can be identified [Zhang


&amp; Norman, 1994]. Internal representations are in the mind


as propositions, productions, schemas, mental images, and so forth.


External representations are in the world (symbols on a paper,


objects on a computer screen, or relations embedded in visual


and spatial layouts). This view on distributed representation


has a significant impact on how we come to understand and evaluate


human cognitive performance.


<p>


Collaborative projects such as InterMed provide a rich repository


of data. The data needs to be collected and synthesized from a


wide range of sources and media, including e-mail, verbal transcripts


of conversations, and products (proposals, papers, progress reports


and implementations at InterMed sites). One needs to develop a


comprehensive and coherent framework for combining the streams


of data to address the critical issues. We will provide a sketch


of such a framework in this proposal. We propose to evaluate the


InterMed project with two complementary objectives in mind. The


first pertains to a formal evaluation process and asks the question:


&quot;To what extent is the InterMed Project fulfilling it's stated


objectives?&quot; The second evaluation focuses on more fundamental


research issues. The objective is to evaluate InterMed as an ongoing


&quot;experiment in computer-mediated collaborative design,&quot;


and to understand what we can learn about this process, and the


Internet as a medium for such an endeavor. Our purpose is to contribute


to the iterative design-implementation-evaluation process, and


in this regard both the formal evaluation and the research-analytic


are essential components. 


<p>


One of the central and longer-term goals of the InterMed project


is to provide a broadly applicable model for shared component-based


collaborative development. We similarly view the ultimate objective


of our evaluation research as the development of a broadly-based


analytic and methodological framework for evaluating and investigating


computer-mediated collaborative design. We anticipate that such


a framework will have the potential to shape models of collaborative


technology development.






<h2>Conclusions</h2>


<p>


Among the InterMed lessons are: (1) the InterMed seven-tiered


architecture has proved to be a useful model for structuring our


collaborative development activities and the sharing of components


and tools; (2) the Web is an effective mechanism for sharing rapidly


changing software, data structures, reports, and diagrams among


geographically distributed workers who use a variety of computing


platforms; (3) e-mail is an effective means of collaborative communication


only after the groundwork has been laid with detailed discussions


and development of a shared culture among the participants; and


(4) existing early applications are demonstrating the viability


of both component-based architectures for building applications


over the Internet and also the feasibility of multi-site collaboration


and sharing. We are also using audio conferencing for group meetings


on a regular basis. The combination of e-mail, audio conferences,


occasional meetings, and shared interests plus a commitment to


collaboration have combined to facilitate the goals of the InterMed


collaboratory.
