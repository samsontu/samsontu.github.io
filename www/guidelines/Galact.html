    GALACTORRHEA
<P>
<I>Max Borten, M.D., J.D.</I>
<P>
A. Galactorrhea is inappropriate lactation in the nonpuerperal
woman. It can be unilateral or bilateral. Any stimulus that causes
a reduction of prolactin inhibiting factor(PIF) secretion by the
hypothalamus enhances the release of pituitary prolactin. Factors
associated with hypothalamic PIF suppression include excessive
estrogen intake (from oral contraceptives, for example), psychotropic
medication (such as diazepam or tricyclic anti-depressants), and
afferent nerve stimulation (as in scars or herpes zoster lesions).
Stress can also inhibit PIF production. Probe for history of breast
stimulation and rule out an intrinsic breast disorder (p 68).

<P>
B. Primary hypothyroidism with reduced circulating thyroid  hormone
results in an increased production of thyrotropin releasing hormone
by the hypothalamus, which acts in turn as a prolactin releasing
factor to raise the circulating prolactin level. Restoration to
a euthyroid state  by the administration of thyroid hormone corrects
the  problem. Women with thyrotoxicosis can also develop idiopathic
galactorrhea and thus deserve full evaluation.  Galactorrhea secondary
to hypothyroidism is usually associated with amenorrhea. Menstrual
function is usually restored merely by correcting the underlying
condition. 
<P>
C. Hyperprolactinemia can generally be detected by analyzing a
single random serum sample for the prolactin level. An increased
prolactin concentration may be due H to decreased PIF production,
increased prolactin elabora tion, or secretion from a pituitary
tumor. Large extrasellar pituitary adenomas (which are usually
nonfunctional tumors) may also mimic the signs and symptoms of
a pituitary prolactinoma. Patients affected by such tumors, however,
will not respond to bromocriptine therapy with shrinkage of the
adenoma. Surgical resection is therefore indicated. Disturbance
in dopamine sensitivity to prolactin feedback may also lead to
hyperprolactinemia by stimulating the pituitary lactotropes to
form an adenoma. 
<P>
D. Hyperprolactinemia is a major cause of anovulation and  infertility.
Galactorrhea resulting from a pituitary adenoma is often associated
with amenorrhea or  oligomenorrhea, although menstrual abnormalities,
including anovulation, can be encountered with essentially normal
prolactin levels. Some euprolactinemic patients with unexplained
infertility and galactorrhea may benefit from low-dose bromocriptine
treatment.
<P>
 
<P>
E. Hyperprolactinemia may represent the first sign of prolactinoma.
Significant elevation of the serum prolactin level is generally
regarded as likely to reflect the existence of a pituitary tumor.
Radiologic evaluations by computer tomography (CT) scan or coronal
x-ray views of the sella turcica are useful for the diagnosis
and follow-up of patients with these tumors. 
<P>
F. A baseline neurologic examination, including visual fields
evaluation, is advisable in patients with hyper-prolactinemia.
Pituitary hormone measurements (growth, luteinizing, follicle
stimulating, and adrenocorticotropic hormones) are also useful
for initially assessing and serially following these patients.
Although inadequate as screening tests, they become most valuable
after a tumor has been identified by computer tomography. 
<P>
G. In most women, hyperprolactinemia has a benign clinical course.
There is no strong evidence that small adenomas necessarily progress
to grow into large tumors. Bromocriptine in titrated doses is
the treatment of choice. During pregnancy, watch for and advise
about head aches, blurred vision, and reduced temporal visual
fields as warning symptoms of pituitary enlargement. Bromocriptine
can also be used for effectively treating a pituitary adenoma
during pregnancy. Surgical extirpation or radiation is reserved
for cases with extensive tumors that<B> </B>fail to respond to
conservative pharmacologic therapy. 
<P>
H. Galactorrhea unaccompanied by pituitary enlargement or menstrual
abnormalities may require nothing more than counseling and reassurance.
Bromocriptine therapy may be used to treat patients who have otherwise
unexplained infertility or galactorrhea. Close follow-up at three-
to six-month intervals is required for visual field biochemical,
and periodic physical examinations.
