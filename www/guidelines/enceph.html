ENCEPHALOPATHY

A. Encephalopathy is an impairment of the level of consciousness; a
disorder of the state of alertness or arousal.  It may take the form of a
quiet, confusional state characterized by lethargy or somnolence, or an
agitated delirium with the appearance of hyperalertness, signs of
sympathetic nervous system overactivity (tachycardia, elevated blood
pressure, fever, tremulousness), and sometimes hallucinations.  A
fluctuating level of consciousness is common.
<P>

B. Blood tests which can suggest a specific cause for encephalopathy
include glucose (hypoglycemia, hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia);
electrolytes (hyponatremia); blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (uremia);
osmolality (alcohol intoxication, hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia);
CBC (meningitis, encephalitis, systemic infection, disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy); PT and PTT (hepatic encephalopathy,
disseminated inravascular coagulopathy); and drug levels (sedative,
anticholinergic, opiate, hallucinogen intoxication).
<P>

C.  Administer dextrose, thiamine, and naloxone without delay, even when
you do not suspect a lesion responsive to these medications. Improvement
following administration of dextrose suggests hypoglycemia; response to
thiamine (often hours to days later) characterizes Wernicke's
encephalopathy (WE); increased alertness and pupillary dilatation are seen
with naloxone in narcotic intoxication.  If metabolic acidosis is found,
attention should be directed to intoxications (e.g., salicylate, methanol,
paraldehyde, ethylene glycol, phenformin, isoniazid), uremia, sepsis, or
the postictal state. If respiratory alkalosis is present, systemic sepsis,
pulmonary infection, hepatic encephalopathy, and salicylate poisoning
should be considered.
<P>

D. When encephalopathy develops in hospital, the patient's hospital chart
and medication record must be scrutinized. Numerous drugs, including
sedatives, analgesics, psychotherapeutic drugs, antiarrhythmics,
anticonvulsants, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, theophylline preparations,
antiparkinsonian medications, and cimetidine, commonly produce
encephalopathy.  Preexisting metabolic disorders may explain an
encephalopathy, as may systemic infections.  Malnutrition states may
suggest Wernicke's encephalopathy.  Surgical patients are at risk for such
sequelae as intraoperative hypotension or hypoxia, infection, electrolyte
disorders, and intoxication with periopertive medications.  A seizure
disorder suggests ence phalopathy due to the postictal state or frequent
unrecognized seizures. Finally, evidence of head trauma may suggest
cerebral contusion or subdural or epidural hematoma.
<P>

E. The physical examination is crucial.  Abnormal vital signs suggest
particular diagnoses: hyperthermia (meningitis, encephalitis, systemic
infections, anticholinergic or hallucinogen intoxication, ethanol or
sedative drug withdrawal); hypothermia (ethanol or sedative drug
intoxication, hepatic encephalopathy, WE); respiratory depression (ethanol,
sedative or narcotic intoxication); and tachypnea (hepatic encephalopathy,
infection).  A stiff neck is frequently seen in meningitis and subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Pinpoint pupils follow opiate intoxication; widely dilated
pupils, anticholinergic or sympathomimetic intoxication. Ethanol or
hallucinogen intoxication produces nystagmus; sedative drug intoxication
and Wernicke's encephalopathy cause nystagmus or ophthalmoplegia. An
asymmetrical motor examination is suggestive of intracranial hemorrhage,
but may also be seen with central nervous system infections or metabolic
disturbances.  Asterixis and myoclonus occur in a variety of metabolic
disorders. Blood in the stool suggests hepatic encephalopathy precipitated
by GI bleeding.
<P>

F.  Lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed on all encephalopathic
patients in whom no definite diagnosis has been made by the time dextrose,
thiamine, and naloxone have been given, and the history and physical
examination completed. If fever, systemic infection, or stiff neck is
present, LP is essential. An exception is the patient with an asymmetrical
neurological examination, who should receive a brain scan before LP. In
addition to establishing the diagnosis of CNS infection or subarachnoid
hemorrhage, the spinal fluid provides the best index of hepatic
encephalopathy (elevated level of glutamine).
