<hr>
The InterMed Collaboratory is a collaborative project involving six participating medical institutions (Stanford University, Columbia University, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, McGill University, and the University of Utah). There are two broad mandates for the effort.  The first is to further the development, sharing, and demonstration of numerous software and system components, data sets, procedures, and tools that will facilitate the collaborations and support the application goals of these projects. The second is to provide a distributed suite of clinical applications, guidelines, and knowledge-bases for clinical, educational, and administrative purposes. We believe that, working together with the Internet as our vehicle for collaboration, we can: (1) accelerate our individual progress in building advanced clinical, educational, and research applications using components made available by our collaborators; (2) build new collaborative applications using shared components and methodology; and (3) provide a broadly applicable model for such collaborative work. The testbeds we have pursued are all clinical in their orientation, and their generalization to the larger informatics community, and to clinical practitioners, is an explicit goal of the work.

In June 1996, a paper summarizing the first two years of InterMed activities (which commenced on May 1, 1994) was presented at the INET '96 meeting (International Meeting of the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</A>) in Montreal, Quebec.  Copies are available in both <A HREF="InterMed.html">HTML</A> and <A HREF="http://smi-web.stanford.edu/pubs/SMI_Reports/SMI-96-0622.pdf">

<H2>Historical Perspective:</H2>

<hr>
<i>The document that follows below describes the InterMed Collaboratory as originally described in the Triad proposal, submitted to the National Library of Medicine in response to its RFP for demonstration projects under the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in 1993. The collaboratory was conceived initially as a collaboration between Stanford, Harvard, and Columbia -- thus the initial name "Triad". The collaboratory has since expanded its list of participants. The InterMed name has been adopted to connote the Internet and medical nature of the effort.  For the purpose of clarity, instances of Triad have thus been replaced with InterMed below.</i>

<H2>1. Background</H2>
In the preface of a recently released report on National Collaboratories from the 
Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Research Council.  
Dr. William Wulf is quoted and succinctly defines the notion underlying our work: 
A national collaboratory is a center without walls, in which the nation's researchers can 
perform their research without regard to geographical location interacting with 
colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] 
accessing information in digital libraries.  The report adds that such a collaboratory is 
"more than a mere interconnection of computers" and offers in addition "a complete 
infrastructure of software, hardware, and networked resources to enable a full range of 
collaborative work among scientists."  Workers from our three institutions believe that, 
working together, we can: (1) accelerate our individual progress in building advanced 
clinical, educational, and research applications using software and information components made available by our collaborators; (2) build new collaborative 
applications using shared components and methodology; and (3) provide a broadly 
applicable model for such collaborative work. Although InterMed is initially conceived as a 
collaboration between Stanford, Harvard, and Columbia, we envision these efforts as 
being precursors to a national (or international) collaboratory with many more 
participants.  Thus scalability is a prime concern.
 <P>
We and others in the medical informatics community have recognized that the 
professional healthcare worker must be able to have access to a variety of resources in a 
problem-specific manner, and that those resources will not exist in a single system or on 
a single platform .  There has also been a growing recognition that no single system can 
incorporate all desirable capabilities without a tremendous developmental burden, 
expense, and duplication of effort.  Information technology experts in the healthcare 
arena now routinely identify the need to provide facile linkages among hospital 
information systems, imaging systems, departmental systems, external databases and 
knowledge bases, and similar components--all requiring a consistent taxonomy of 
concepts and well-articulated descriptions of components and how they must interact.  
Advanced computing and communications capabilities offer great hope for distributing 
system capabilities over high speed networks while introducing new technologies for 
multimedia, video conferencing, and specialized computing (such as parallel search and 
3-D modeling).  Anticipating the rapid change in computing power and communications that is imminent, the InterMed group seeks to demonstrate the viability of the collaboratory concept.

<P>


All of our institutions have been contributing independently for many years to the development of relevant collaborative technologies, and the CAMIS resource, following on from SUMEX-AIM, forms a corner stone of the proposed work.  InterMed offers a mechanism for extending (and gaining leverage from) the work of the CAMIS 
community on a national scale.  We propose experiments to build on the CAMIS 
experience (described in this report) by demonstrating the feasibility and utility of 
distributed, network-based collaboration.  In this extension of our work, we will create 
electronically mediated collaborative links between the Stanford CAMIS community, 
the  Decision Systems Group (DSG) at Harvard, and the Columbia Presbyterian Medical 
Center (CPMC).  The DSG has focused for several years on developing an object-
oriented software architecture for creating applications as compositions of externally 
developed information resources.  This area of technology is central to being able to 
construct rapidly complex software systems that can be shared between groups.  The 
CPMC is one of the academic centers that has pioneered the implementation and 
evolution of the concept of Integrated Academic (or Advanced) Information 
Management Systems (IAIMS).  After four years of planning and prototyping, CPMC is 
now completing a five-year implementation phase during which a wide variety of 
academic, administrative and patient-care departments have collaborated to develop a 
complex, integrated information environment which serves research, patient care, 
teaching and administrative functions.
 

<P>


We are now at a point where distributed computing and communications technologies, 
the maturity of the field of medical informatics, and the perceived urgency of solving 
clinical-care management problems in the United States have made it possible and 
necessary to build workable approaches to inter-institutional links envisioned in this 
collaboratory.  Our three institutions are well positioned to show how this can work, 
and we are highly enthusiastic to demonstrate our ability to do so.

<H2>2. Objectives and Research Tasks</H2>


The research proposed under InterMed includes the development, sharing, and demonstration of numerous software and systems components, datasets, procedures, and tools that will facilitate collaborations and support the application goals of the 
project.  To help define the relationships and interactions among these elements, we 
have identified a model composed of seven tiers:


<OL>
<LI> Network and Services: The network itself (Internet), plus the associated 
systems methodologies that support use of the network for collaboration


<br><br><LI> Vocabulary:  The taxonomies and vocabularies needed to support 
components and applications


<br><br><LI> Knowledge and Data:  The databases and knowledge bases on which 
clinical tools and applications are built


<br><br><LI> Agents and Components:  The agents and components that build on the 
elements in Tiers 1 through 3 and provide the power for modular construction of systems


<br><br><LI> Development Environments:  The application frameworks and authoring 
or prototyping tools that depend on the components and agents while providing user 
interfaces for application creation


<br><br><LI> Testbed Applications:  Applications to support clinical care, education, and decision making


<br><br><LI> Collaborative Policies:  The policies, principles, and guidelines (regarding ownership, liability, intellectual property, confidentiality, security, and the like) that 
must be developed and implemented in defining models by which applications are 
constructed, and software is shared, across communication networks
</OL>


Many technical tasks have been proposed to realize the components and tools required 
at each level.  This work is in turn strongly motivated by a number of testbed 
applications (Tier 6) that will allow us to demonstrate the utility of both the 
collaborative methodologies and the component-based architectures that we intend to 
pursue.  Our actual research work will be to develop the underlying infrastructure and 
components rather than the testbed applications themselves.  Still the applications 
summarized below help to illustrate the collaboratory concept and its practical relevance:


<UL>
<LI>Investigators at Stanford and Columbia will develop software packages that can 
be used for the merging, managing, and searching the standardized vocabulary in a network-based entities dictionary.  Such applications are crucial for the long-term management of the vocabularies that underlie clinical medicine and that evolve 
naturally over time as we learn more about human disease and its treatment.  The lack of standardized nomenclatures is frequently cited as a major barrier to the evolution 
and successful implementation of computer-based medical records and clinical 
decision-support tools.  Our work will be carefully coordinated and related to the ongoing UMLS effort led by the National Library of Medicine.


<br><br><LI>Workers at Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford will collaborate on the creation and 
use of medical courseware that builds on the image libraries and image manipulation 
and presentation tools to be provided as part of this project.  Both Harvard and Stanford 
are members of the National Educational Medical School Consortium (NEMSC), an 
organization of 13 medical schools committed to development of medical education 
software.  It is recognized by the NEMSC members that adoption at one school of 
courseware developed by another school is often less than enthusiastic.  This has prompted a view that this process could be improved if sharing were not based solely 
on completed applications but also on the ability to utilize shared information resources 
to custom tailor or adapt applications to local needs.  


<br><br><LI>Stanford, Harvard, and Columbia will collaborate on the creation of methods for 
sharing clinical guidelines.  Stanford and Columbia will focus on sharable guidelines for 
the management of AIDS and HIV-related disease.  Stanford has experience in this area 
due to its development of an integrated workstation for management of patients with 
HIV (see the T-Helper report in Section xxx).  Adapting those clinical guidelines for 
sharing with Columbia, including their integration into workstations used in 
Columbia's AIDS clinic, will be another appropriate testbed for the collaborative 
methodologies proposed.  Harvard team members at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, 
Harvard Community Health Plan, and Massachusetts General Hospital will focus on 
developing means of sharing clinical guideline libraries in specific areas (radiology 
guidelines, AHCPR guidelines initially), and the development of tools for authoring 
guidelines.  


<br><br><LI>Brigham and Women's Hospital has developed order-entry screens that include 
internal logic for the implementation of certain clinical guidelines and facilitating rapid 
access to relevant clinical data.  Columbia and Harvard propose to collaborate so that such guidelines and access criteria can be jointly developed and shared between the two institutions, along with the order-entry screens themselves, so as to facilitate clinical decision-support while avoiding duplication of effort between the two institutions.


<br><br><LI>Stanford has ongoing experiments in the area of mobile, pen-based computing to 
provide a portable interface to its T-Helper system.  Although the T-Helper clinical 
database has provided a useful testbed for the development of this interface, they need 
to extend their work into the area of mobile computing for inpatient services as well.  
Lacking local access to an inpatient database, Stanford will collaborate with Columbia 
on the use of inpatient clinical data from CPMC as the basis for experimentation on 
interface development at Stanford.  


<br><br><LI>Harvard is initiating development of a clinical workstation testbed at the 
Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP).  
This workstation emphasizes the integration of radiologic reporting and image review, 
differential diagnosis, video consultation, guidelines for radiologic workup, and links to 
the BWH and HCHP systems for order entry.  This testbed will demonstrate the results 
of both collaborative sharing of InterMed resources in its implementation, as well as a new 
degree of local collaboration.  In addition, Harvard-based tools and capabilities used in 
its development will be provided to the InterMed.  


<br><br><LI>Our final specific aim, not yet mentioned explicitly in the seven-tier model, is the 
evaluation of our collaborative methodology.  We seek to utilize evaluation techniques 
suitable for each level of the model at which we are making contributions.  Our focus 
will be on evaluating the collaboration itself, not the components, agents, frameworks, 
or applications that we will develop.  For example, instrumentation of network 
resources to measure frequency of accesses, email exchanges, and similar indications of 
the health of the collaboration will be implemented.  A structured collaboration such as 
this will require that we address the inevitable policy and procedural issues that will 
arise as inter-institutional joint projects emerge.  Part of our work will be to evaluate the 
problems and benefits of such collaboration.
