</B></I></FONT><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the Intermed/EON model of guidelines, we use the notion of "Steps" to define the control structure of a clinical guideline. The Steps are specialized into ActionStep, ConditionStep, BranchStep, and SynchronizationStep. This note explains the intended use of SynchronizationStep, over which there are considerable confusion.</P>
<P>The basic idea behind SynchronizationStep is that we need a way to specify the meaning of situations where the same step follows more than one steps, that is, the values of the next_step attribute of multiple steps are the same. Graphically, the ‘next_step’ links of several nodes converge on the same node. To disambiguate among three alternatives that we model, we use a SynchronizationStep has the ‘continuation’ attribute, whose value can be ‘wait_for_all,’ ‘procede_after_one’ (Figure 1b) and a default case where the SynchronizationStep is implicit (Figure 1a).</P>

<P>The two allowed values of the continuation attribute is designed to model the following two scenarios:</P>
<P>1. A and B are potentially parallel threads of execution. Do C only after A and B have been completed (the wait_for_all case). Example: Give a drug ( C ) only after two other drugs (A and B) have been given.</P>
<P>2. A and B are potentially parallel threads of execution. Do C after A or B has been completed. If a second thread of execution reaches the SynchronizationStep, that thread is not continued (the procede_after_one case). Example: Perform an intervention ( C ) after obtaining information from either A or B. Do not repeat the intervention after each test.</P>
<P>The default case models the third scenario</P>
<P>3. A and B are not parallel threads of execution. Do C after A or B has been completed. If the control flow reaches C multiple times, repeat the execution of C as often as necessary. Example, C is an intervention that should be given multiple times. Node B is a Condition_Step that checks the number of times C has been given previously.</P>
