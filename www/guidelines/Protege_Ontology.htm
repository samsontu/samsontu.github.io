<b><font size=+2>GLIF Ontology and Validation Tool</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The GuideLine Interchange Format (GLIF) is a computer-interpretable
language for modeling and executing clinical practice guidelines, currently
in the development stage by the <a href="http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/intermed-web">InterMed
team</a>. GLIF will allow sharing of computer-interpretable clinical guidelines
across different medical institutions and system platforms, facilitating
the contextual adaptation of a guideline to the local setting and integrating
them with the electronic medical record systems. GLIF has a formal representation.
It defines an ontology for representing guidelines, as well as a medical
ontology for representing medical data and concepts. The medical ontology
is designed to facilitate the mappings from the GLIF representation to
different electronic patient record systems. We are also developing tools
for guideline authoring and execution and a guideline server, from which
GLIF-encoded guidelines could be browsed through the internet, downloaded,
and locally adapted.

<p>The <b>validation tool </b>is included in the GLIF ontology (version
3.5). To view it, select from the Project menu the option Configure, and
check the box PAlConstraintsTab. Next, press on the PalConstraints Tab.
Use the '+' on the top to select constraints. Then, press on "Warn about..".
Next press on "Evaluate...". If you get a red mark, then click on it to
see instances that violate the constraint.

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Disclaimer</font></b>: <b>the guidelines encoding
was done as part of Intermed research to test the adequacy of the GLIF
formalism. They encode only a part of the guidelines, and have not been
validated by clinicians or tested with patient cases. They should only
be seen as examples of GLIF encoding and not medically valid guidelines.</b>
