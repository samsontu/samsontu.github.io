A. Breast self-examination is acknowledged to be of limited value
principally because it is inconsistently reliable and few women
are diligent and attentive. Despite this, the practice can be
justified on the basis of the occasional breast cancer it detects.
Teaching the needs for and the details of breast self-examination
should be reinforced by encouraging the patient to practice it
with regularity. The importance of early detection must be repeatedly
stressed. Discovery of a mass in the breast will usually prompt
a patient to visit her gynecologist, although some exhibit a regrettable
reluctance to do so. Notwithstanding that the majority of breast
masses are of a benign nature, it is essential to undertake a
complete evaluation before one can reassure the patient. Elicit
a background of risk factors for breast cancer in her personal
and family history.

B. Inspection of the breasts is the first step in the examination.
It should be carried out with the patient sitting, first with
her arms at her sides and then overhead. Palpation of the breast
is usually performed with the patient supine. Any abnormality
noted on inspection or palpation should be further pursued by
examination in the sitting and standing positions. Look for significant
signs of asymmetry, nipple deviation, retraction, induration,
edema, fixation, or tumor bulging. Breast cancer often initially
presents as a nontender firm lump with ill-defined, in distinct
margins. Identifying this dominant mass is the principal objective
of the examination. 
<P>
C. The absence of an identifiable mass by physical examination
nation is reassuring. Nevertheless, re-evaluation at regular intervals
is indicated. In women 30 years of age or more, a baseline mammography
should be obtained. It offers objective evidence for the absence
of a malignancy and serves for later comparison studies to help
in early recognition of any pattern changes that may arise in
the future. Foremost, the patient must be made to feel that she
has fulfilled an important screening function by self examining
her breasts even though findings are negative at the time of this
examination. 
<P>
D. Consistency of the breast mass can be assessed by palpation.
When in doubt, ultrasonographic evaluation aids in differentiating
between a cystic fluid-filled mass and one with solid components.
Cystic masses are<B> </B>amenable to expeditious fine-needle aspiration;
the patient should not ordinarily have to return for this simple
procedure. Identification of a solid tumor (or cystic mass with
residual al solid component after aspiration) usually requires
surgical exploration. A preoperative baseline mammography is helpful
in disclosing unsuspected secondary lesions in either the affected
or the contralateral breast. 
<P>
E. Fine-needle aspiration of a cystic breast mass is usually carried
out in the office setting. Fluid aspiration permits   cytologic
evaluation of any suspicious material. Clear or straw-colored
fluid is considered benign and the fluid can be discarded. It
is imperative to re-evaluate immediately following aspiration
and six weeks thereafter to con   firm that the suspicious breast
mass is no longer palpable. If one cannot aspirate fluid from
a mass that is thought   to be cystic, it must be treated as if
it were solid. Failure to decompress a cystic breast mass completely
by aspiration indicates the tumor probably has some solid component
  to it. Excisional biopsy is needed even though the aspirated
fluid appears to be benign. Bloody or serosanguineous fluid should
be viewed as reflecting a potentially neoplastic lesion; because
it may contain   malignant cells, microscopic cytologic study
is essential. 
<P>

F. A negative mammographic evaluation does not completely
rule out the possibility of a breast malignancy. Excisional biopsy
of a persistent breast lump is indicated irrespective of the negative
results of any diagnostic test. Delayed recognition of an irreducible
mass is a common reason breast carcinoma is not diagnosed in its
early stages. When in doubt, appropriate referral to a more experienced
physician is indicated.
