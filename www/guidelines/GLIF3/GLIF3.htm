<p> <b>Abstract:</b> The Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) is a language for 
  structured representation of guidelines that was developed for the purpose of 
  facilitating sharing of clinical guidelines. GLIF version 2, which was published 
  in 1998, enabled the modeling of a clinical guideline as a flowchart of structured 
  guideline steps, representing clinical actions and decisions. However, the attributes 
  of structured constructs were defined as text strings that could not be parsed. 
  Such guidelines could therefore not be used for computer-based execution. The 
  next version of GLIF (known as GLIF3) is designed to support computer-based 
  execution. GLIF3 introduces several new constructs and extends existing GLIF2 
  constructs to allow a more formal definition of decision criteria, action specifications 
  and patient data. The new GLIF3 constructs enable the encoding of guidelines 
  at three levels: a conceptual GLIF flowchart, a computable/parsable specification 
  that can be verified for logical consistency and completeness, and an implementable 
  specification that is appropriate for incorporation into particular institutional 
  information system environments.
