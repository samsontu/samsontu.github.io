<p> <b>Abstract:</b> The Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) and the Arden Syntax 
  are methodologies that were created for the purpose of sharing certain kinds 
  of medical knowledge. While the Arden Syntax is already a standard of the American 
  Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and has been used to implement medical 
  decision rules, GLIF is an evolving methodology for representing the logic and 
  flow of clinical guidelines. In this paper we seek to define the relationship 
  between GLIF and the Arden Syntax, highlighting the complementary role that 
  they play in sharing medical knowledge. While the Arden Syntax was designed 
  to represent single decision rules in self-contained units called Medical Logic 
  Modules (MLMs), GLIF specifies entire guidelines that are generally intended 
  to unfold over time. An MLM has a single specification that is computable, while 
  guideline development in GLIF can be done at three different levels of abstraction: 
  an conceptual flowchart of medical decisions and actions, a computable specification 
  that includes well-defined delineation of decision criteria and patient data, 
  and an implementable specification, that includes local adaptations and mapping 
  of guideline variables to institutional databases. The current version of GLIF 
  uses a superset of the Arden Syntax logic grammar to specify logical and temporal 
  decision criteria, but includes additional constructs that support other elements 
  required by complex clinical guidelines. GLIF also includes an MLM-macro class 
  that enables mapping of guideline recommendations into MLMs, in cases where 
  the implementing institution wishes to use MLMs.
