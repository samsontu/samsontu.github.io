  Functional requirements for sharable guidelines; 1999. Report No.: IM-2000-1. 
<p> <b>Abstract:</b> Recent trends in health care delivery have led to an increased 
  emphasis on the development of guidelines for prevention, diagnostic work-up, 
  treatment, and patient-management processes. Such guidelines are motivated by 
  concerns about marked variations in clinical practice and are designed to help 
  to provide a common standard of care both within a health care organization 
  and among different organizations. For better integration of guidelines into 
  the clinical workflow, they are increasingly being disseminated and implemented 
  using computer-based systems. The range of possible applications for computer-based 
  guidelines is very broad, including use for disease management, encounter workflow 
  facilitation, reminders/alerts, design and conduct of clinical trials, care 
  plan/critical path support, appropriateness determination, risk assessment, 
  demand management, education and training, and reference. Computer-based approaches 
  to representation of guidelines are being developed by various groups. Critical 
  to sharing of the knowledge in these guidelines across institutional, national, 
  and medical domain boundaries would be adoption of a common format for representing 
  them. In order to be widely usable and acceptable, such a common representation 
  for guidelines must provide several functional capabilities. The representation 
  must account for requirements for (a) human communication, (b) validation of 
  logical consistency and completeness (not correctness), and (c) incorporation 
  into institutional information system environments. We hereby propose a set 
  of functional requirements for a sharable guideline representation language 
  and briefly provide their underlying rationale.
