<p> <b>Abstract:</b> Sharing of clinical practice guidelines is intended to facilitate 
  a number of objectives, which include: 1. Improved design of guidelines, through 
  use of authoring tools that support structuring and documentation of GLs, including 
  linking to evidence, design collaboration, ability to conceptualize and iteratively 
  refine specifications, etc. 2. Improved ability to verify consistency, completeness, 
  and lack of ambiguity (software validation - as opposed to medical validation, 
  which is beyond the scope of this effort) 3. Well formed specification that 
  enables guidelines to be incorporated into a wide variety of applications, integrated 
  into local environments, and adapted to practice variations and local constraints 
  Our goal is to address these three objectives in the development of a representation 
  approach that enables sharing. It is instructive to realize that the above objectives 
  also correspond to different levels at which guideline sharing needs to be addressed. 
  We believe that many of the issues around development of a standard representation 
  can be resolved if one carefully considers the level at which a particular concern 
  impacts on the representation. Note though that while we present the three levels 
  of representation sequentially, they are often done concurrently, with feedback 
  from the efforts at one level identifying problems at another level.
