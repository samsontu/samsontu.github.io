A. Diarrhea is one of the most common complaints resulting in
visits to a physician. The history and physical (including rectal
examination) are critical in determining who needs further diagnostic
evaluation and in selecting appropriate therapy. Important questions
to ask are length of illness, volume of stool, presence of blood
or pus in stool, and symptoms of systemic illness such as fever,
anorexia, weight loss, and volume depletion. Most patients should
not undergo further evaluation at this time but be treated symptomatically.
However, the presence of systemic symptoms dictates that the stool
be more closely evaluated for evidence of invasive infection or
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
<P>
B. The simplest test that can be performed in the office to evaluate
inflammatory changes of the bowel mucosa is to inspect by microscopy
a fecal sample for WBCs/RBCs. The presence of either of these
implies infection with invasive organisms and/or IBD.
<P>
C. To evaluate infection by an invasive bacterial organism, a
stool culture is necessary. Most clinical laboratories routinely
test for <I>Shigella, Salmonella, </I>and <I>Gmpylobacter </I>spp.
If travel or other historical features suggest others, more specific
testing for Amoeba, <I>Yersinia spp. </I>or <I>Clostridium difficile,
</I>and others may be necessary. 
<P>
D. In patients with WBCs/RBCs in the stool and negative culture,
or those without inflammatory ce? but continued diarrhea, perform
flexible sigmoidoscopy to evaluate the presence of IBD, which
may present even if the mucosa is grossly normal appearing. Thus,
a biopsy is helpful to detect minimal mucosal changes. In addition,
the histologic appearance in the setting of gross inflammatory
changes could help differentiate acute infectious self-limited
coli from IBD. A biopsy should generally be performed irrespective
of gross findings. 
<P>
E. In patients with negative cultures and sigmoidoscopy but continued
diarrhea, further evaluation may be required.
