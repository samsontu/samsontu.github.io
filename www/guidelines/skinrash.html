SKIN RASH

In critically ill patients, a skin rash may be a dramatic diagnostic clue,
particularly since infectious causes even those of viral origin, may be
fully treatable.
<p>

A.  It is important to ascertain exactly the relationship of the onset of
the rash to the presenting illness. Most rashes that occur as a secondary
phenomenon in hospitalized patients are drug-allergy related; antibiotics
are the most likely culprits.  Overlap with a primary disease rnay be
found; in addition, hospitalized patients may develop, as a secondary
process, most of the diseases noted in paragraphs B-F.  Drug rashes are
commonly seen as either a fine erythema tomacular rash, involving the trunk
and the extremities but usually sparing the palms and soles, or as a
classic urticarial allergic manifestation.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a
life-threatening rash involving the mucous membranes; treatment with
steroids may be beneficial.

B.  In the presence of a maculopapular rash, an important diagnosis to
consider, particularly in young, menstruating women who use tampons and
present with apparent septic shock, is toxic shock syndrome;
characteristically, the rash involves the palms of the hands and the soles
and the feet.  Other common causes of maculopapular rash include measles
and other viral infections.
<p>

C.  Nodulopapular rashes may suggest, in the right clinical setting,
disseminated granulomatous diseases such as miliary tuberculosis (TB) or
fungal infections (e.g., coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis,
Candida). Biopsy with histopathology and culture is almost always indicated
for definition of the process. Biopsy should be avoided in the neutropenic
patient.
<p>

D.  Bacterial cellulitis (commonly streptococcal or staphylococcal but may
be caused by gram-negative organisms) usually does not present a diagnostic
problem, except for the mimicking presentation of erythema nodosum. If
erythema nodosum is suspected, biopsy of the lesion is
required. Necrotizing cellulitis or anaerobic fasciitis needs immediate
surgical intervention as well as appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
<p>

E.  Petechial and purpuric rashes usually indicate the more
life-threatening diagnoses, with meningococcemia highest on the "worry"
list.  Blood cultures should yield the diagnosis. Immediate use of antibio
tics may be crucial; these diagnoses must be considered medical
emergencies.  Rocky mountain spotted fever (RMSF) or dengue fever may be
the source of the rash. Thrombocytopenia unrelated to infection must also
be investigated.
<p>

F.  Vesicular or bullous skin eruptions usually indicate disseminated
herpes zoster or simplex infection in the immunocompromised host; treatment
with acyclovir may be indicated. Culture of blister nuid can yield the
diagnosis. The only other critical diagnosis to consider is the
staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). The llaccid bullae of SSSS
desquamate and denude the skin and are easily distinguished from the
vesicular viral eruptions. Search for a primary staphylococcal infection
and antibiotic therapy are crucial. A toxin released by the staphylococcus
is the putative agent. Staphylococcal and streptococcal impetigo can
present bullous lesions around the cellulitis.
