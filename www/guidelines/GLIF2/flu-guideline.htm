<H2>1995-96 abstract of ACIP Recommendations  <BR>
</H2>

<P>
The U.S. Public Health Service's Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee (ACIP) recommendations for use of 1995-96 influenza
vaccine (MMWR April 21, 1995/Vol.44/No.RR-3) are summarized below:
 <BR>

<P>
Influenza vaccine* dosage, by age of patient - 1995-96 season
 <BR>

<P>
Age Group Product+ Dosage Doses Route  <BR>

<P>
6 - 35 mos Split virus only 0.25 mL 1 or 2** IM  <BR>

<P>
3 - 8 yrs Split virus only 0.50 mL 1 or 2** IM  <BR>

<P>
9 - 12 yrs Split virus only 0.50 mL 1 IM  <BR>

<P>
&gt; - 12 yrs Whole or split 0.50 mL 1 IM  <BR>

<P>
virus  <BR>

<P>
* Contains 15 ug each of A/Texas/36/91-like (H1N1), A/Johannesburg/33/94-like
(H3N2), and B/Beijing/184/93-like hemagglutinin antigens in each
0.5 mL. The actual influenza type B strain used by U.S. manufacturers
is B/Harbin/07/94, which is antigenically equivalent to the B/Beijing/184/93
strain. Manufacturers include Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Fluzonereg.
whole or split); Evans Medical Ltd. (Fluviron(TM) purified surface
antigen vaccine); Parke-Davis (Fluogenreg. split); and Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories (Flushield(TM) split). For further product information,
call one of the vaccine manufacturers.<BR>

<P>
+ Because of the lower potential for causing febrile reactions,
only split virus (subvirion) vaccines should be used in children.
Immunogenicity and side effects of split and whole virus vaccines
are similar in adults when vaccines are used according to the
recommended dosage.<BR>

<P>
It may be desirable to administer influenza vaccine to high-risk
children when they receive routine pediatric vaccines, but in
a different anatomic site. Although studies of all possible vaccine
combinations have not been conducted, simultaneous administration
should not lessen immunogenicity or enhance adverse reactions.
<BR>

<P>
The recommended site of immunization is the deltoid muscle for
adults and older children. The preferred site for infants and
young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh muscle.
<BR>

<P>
** Two doses administered at least 1 month apart are recommended
for children under 9 years old who are receiving influenza vaccine
for the first time.<BR>

<P>
The ACIP strongly recommends annual influenza immunization for
persons in the following groups, unless a contraindication exists:
<BR>

<H2>GROUPS AT INCREASED RISK FOR INFLUENZA-RELATED COMPLICATIONS
<BR>
</H2>

<P>
a) Adults and children with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary
system conditions, including children with asthma.<BR>

<P>
b) Residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities
housing patients of any age with chronic medical conditions.<BR>

<P>
c) Otherwise healthy persons 65 years old and older. (Persons
aged 60 years and older may receive the state-purchased influenza
vaccine.)<BR>

<P>
d) Adults and children with chronic metabolic diseases (including
diabetes mellitus), renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or
immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications),
that required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during
the preceding year.<BR>

<P>
e) Children and teenagers (6 months through 18 years of age) on
long-term aspirin therapy.<BR>

<H2>GROUPS CAPABLE OF INFECTING HIGH-RISK PERSONS<BR>
</H2>

<P>
Physicians, nurses, and other health care personnel (e.g., primary
care and certain specialty clinicians and staff of chronic care
facilities and intensive-care units, particularly neonatal intensive-care
units), visiting nurses, volunteer workers, and family/household
members, including children, who have extensive contact with the
high-risk persons.<BR>

<P>
The Committee recommends that the vaccine be given in clinics,
nursing homes, other chronic care facilities, physicians' offices,
and hospitals in mid-October through mid-November. Vaccine can
be given earlier (September-October) if influenza activity begins
earlier than normal, regionally, or if high-risk patients who
are discharged from the hospital or outpatient clinics earlier
in the fall may not be seen again until after November.<BR>

<P>
The ACIP has recommended influenza immunization as a prudent precaution
for HIV-infected persons. A recent study indicated that influenza
immunization can cause a temporary rise in the amount of HIV in
the blood of HIV-infected persons but, to date, the ACIP has not
changed its recommendation, and CDC recommends no change.<BR>

<P>
While not making a strong recommendation for the following groups,
the ACIP states that persons providing essential community services
(e.g., police and fire department staff) may be considered for
immunization during severe influenza epidemics and that any person
wishing to reduce his/her chances of influenza may be given the
vaccine by his/her physician, unless a contraindication exists.
Persons mentioned in this paragraph do not normally qualify for
receipt of the state-purchased influenza vaccine.<BR>
