    <h1>Knowtator</h1>
    <h1>Version: 1.8</h1>
    <p>
Knowtator is a general-purpose text annotation tool that is integrated with the 
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; knowledge representation system. Knowtator facilitates the 
manual creation of training and evaluation corpora for a variety of biomedical 
language processing tasks.  
<p>
Building on the strengths of the widely used Prot&eacute;g&eacute; knowledge representation system, 
we have developed Knowtator as a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; plugin that leverages Prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s knowledge 
representation capabilities to specify annotation schemas.  
Knowtator's unique advantage over other annotation tools is the ease with which 
complex annotation schemas (e.g. schemas which have constrained relationships 
between entity types) can be defined and incorporated into use.  
Additionally, because annotation schemas are defined using a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontology, 
it is straightforward to incorporate domain knowledge into an annotation schema 
for semantic annotation.
