Amnesty International is a grassroots movement.  Much of our work is

done by our network of volunteer groups.  We have groups in

communities and churches and on high school and college campuses.

There are professional networks of lawyers, health professionals, and

educators.  We very much hope that you will consider joining one of

these groups.

<p>

We invite you to contact us if you would like to join their efforts to

release prisoners of conscience, to focus on targeted country

campaigns, or to work on other human rights issues such as torture,

refugees, and the death penalty.  Groups are also involved with

outreach and media work in their communities, constantly seeking to

increase the visibility of Amnesty International's human rights

message.  If you would like to consider starting a group in your own

community, please contact us and we can provide you with all the

information you need to do this, as well as connect you with an

experienced Amnesty member who can directly assist you.  If you are a

student and are interested in starting an Amnesty group at your school,

or in finding out if there is a group already, please call us and we will

provide you with this information as well.

<p>

Thanks again for your interest.  We hope that you will contact us if

you have further questions, and that you will soon be joining the

worldwide network of Amnesty International activists!

For the purpose of servicing members, AIUSA divides USA into five

regions, each with a Regional Office. Here is a list of their

addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and pointers to local
