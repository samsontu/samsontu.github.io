<H1>USA: POLICE BRUTALITY WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN NEW YORK CITY
<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<B>NEW YORK</B> - Reports of
police brutality, shootings and deaths in police custody in New
York City have risen significantly in recent years, with more
than two-thirds of the victims belonging to racial minorities,
Amnesty International said today.
<P>
      In a new report released today, the human rights
organization said that while there has been an increase in prosecutions
for police corruption in recent years,  prosecutions for beatings
or unjustified shootings by on-duty police are rare and convictions
even rarer.
<P>
      Disturbingly, many of the police shootings
did not appear to justify firing guns and many of the people allegedly
kicked or beaten by police were not criminal suspects but people
who had simply questioned police authority or had minor disagreements
with officers. Nearly all the victims in the cases of deaths in
custody and police shootings reviewed by Amnesty International
were from racial minorities -- particularly African-Americans,
Latinos and  Asians.
<P>
      &quot;Police brutality is not limited to minorities
and may be a sign of a wider police culture,&quot; Amnesty International
said. &quot;However, much of the abuse seems to be racially motivated
and serious questions must be asked -- and answered -- when racial
minorities bear the brunt of police brutality and are overwhelmingly
the victims of death at the hands of the police.&quot;
<P>
      The 72-page report follows an 18-month investigation
by Amnesty International, including two research visits to the
city, and reviews more than 90 individual cases of alleged ill-treatment
and excessive force by police officers from the late 1980s to
1996.
<H2>Police Brutality</H2>

<P>
      The most common forms of ill-treatment alleged
were repeated kicks or punches by officers using fists, batons,
guns and police radios, sometimes while the person was already
 handcuffed or restrained in another way. In several cases, people
died after being restrained by police officers.
<P>
       In one case in April 1995, police officers
mistook Marcos Maldonado, a Latino supermarket worker, for a suspect
following an armed robbery at the store. He claimed that they
handcuffed his hands behind his back, threw him on the floor,
repeatedly hit him on the back of the head with their pistols
and nightsticks, and kicked him in the back, chest and legs. While
he was handcuffed, an officer reportedly used an ethnic slur and
threatened to &quot;blow his head off&quot;. Marcos Maldonado
was treated at hospital for bruises and cuts to his head and hands.
<P>
      The commanding officer later informed Amnesty
International that, while a complaint was pending before the civilian
review board, a police investigation had found that the officers
involved had acted &quot;totally within the parameters of both
New York state law and guidelines set forth by the New York City
Police Department&quot; and that all officers had been returned
to full duty.
<P>
      New York state law and police department policy
state that police officers may use only &quot;the minimum amount
of force which is necessary to achieve a legitimate purpose when
other options are not available or have been exhausted&quot;.
The guidelines also state that flashlights, radios and handguns
are not designed as impact weapons and make clear that they should
not be used as such in most circumstances. They also note that
failure to follow the guidelines constitutes an offence under
the law as well as departmental policy.
<P>
      &quot;On paper it's clear what force a police
officer can use. In practice, police have in many cases apparently
completely  ignored both the NYPD's own guidelines and international
standards,&quot; Amnesty International said.
<H2>Lethal force</H2>

<P>
      In more than 30 cases suspects have been shot,
killed or injured by NYC police officers in questionable circumstances
in recent years.  There are serious doubts about whether the suspects
had posed an immediate threat to life when they were shot, even
though NYPD officers may fire their guns only as a last resort
to protect life. Most of the victims -- including several teenagers
-- were unarmed at the time they were shot. 
<P>
      On 24 March 1995, Yong Xin Huang, a 16-year-old
Chinese boy and some friends were spotted playing in a garden
with an air rifle in Brooklyn. Alerted by a neighbour, a police
officer arrived and fatally shot the young boy in the back of
his head. In March 1996 the city agreed to pay $400,000 in damages
to the family; the officer was not disciplined or charged with
an offence.
<P>
       On 12 January 1996,  Frankie Arzuega, an unarmed
15- year old Puerto Rican boy, was a passenger in the back seat
of a reportedly stolen car. He was shot dead by a police officer
after the driver tried to drive off while being questioned.
<H2>Deaths in Custody</H2>

<P>
      Amnesty International reviewed 15 cases of
deaths in police custody between 1988 and 1995 -- most of which
took place on the streets.  The cases included people who had
died of  asphyxia from pressure on the neck or chest, those who
had signs of being hit or prisoners who died after violent struggles
with police officers. Two of the prisoners who died in custody
in 1995 had been sprayed with the pepper-spray, an agent used
to temporarily disable a target subject.              According
to police statistics, 89% of those who died in New York Police
Department custody between 1990 and 1994 were African American
or Hispanic. These figures alone are disturbing and warrant an
independent inquiry, Amnesty International said.
<H2> Prosecutions or disciplinary action</H2>

<P>
      Amnesty International said it was not able
to get all the details of the cases examined because investigations
into police abuse are shrouded in secrecy. Police internal disciplinary
reports are confidential under New York State law and even the
findings of the independent civilian review board in individual
cases are confidential.
<P>
      The police authorities did not respond to most
of Amnesty International questions on whether internal disciplinary
action had been taken against officers in the specific cases reviewed.
However, very few officers had been reportedly disciplined, and
only minor sanctions were imposed against those found guilty of
misconduct.
<P>
      The report points out that a police officer
convicted in April 1995 for shooting to death an unarmed black
man sitting in his car was the first New York City police officer
to be convicted for an on-duty homicide since 1977.
<P>
      &quot;The New York City authorities should
appoint an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality,
deaths in custody and police shootings. Concrete measures should
be taken to prevent such abuses and greater transparency should
be adopted in the investigation of complaints,&quot;  Amnesty
International said.
