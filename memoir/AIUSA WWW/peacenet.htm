<P>
The special WideOpen server account gives the Webmaster a UNIX
prompt, and total control over the Web Site He telnets to the
WideOpen server, so there is no usage charge and he would FTP
files to IGC and then telnet in for last minute edits and perhaps
to move files around
<P>
IGC also offer consultation on design and programming at an hourly
rate For an example of IGC's service, take a look at http://wwwfvpforg/
which just went up They are also one of our clients, and I know
for sure they have no one on staff that could have created those
pages, nor do they have an enormous budget for full-scale professional
help They even have SSL financial transaction implemented! The
only criticism I would make of the pages is that they haven't
fully taken into account the low tech user, since there are no
