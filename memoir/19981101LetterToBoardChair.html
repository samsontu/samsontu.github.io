To:  Chair of AIUSA Board of Directors<br>
From: Samson Tu<br>
Date: November 1, 1998<br>
Re: AIUSA web coordinator/Schulz memo<br>
Cc: AIUSA Board of Directors, Executive Director </p>
<p>
I saw in the Unapproved Minutes of the [1998] September Board meeting a number of
items related to AIUSA's work on the Internet and I became aware of a memo [the 
Executive Director] sent to all staff concerning the web coordinator position and HXN's future access to staff. As someone who was involved in the development
of AIUSA's website from the very beginning, these events have concerned me
deeply.
<p>
Some of you may remember that AIUSA's website on IGC was originally created and
maintained in 1996 by volunteers. DH, JP, HXN,
and I were the principal developers. We worked closely together as a team. We
were members of the [AIUSA] Computer Communication Working Group/Computer Communication
Resource Group that recommended to the Board in 1996 that AIUSA hire a staff
web coordinator to expand the functionality of the website. The Board approved
our recommendations at the June 1996 Board meeting in New Orleans. DH and
JP left the web developer team, so only HXN and I were maintaining the AIUSA website at IGC when RQ was hired 
[as the AIUSA web coordinator].
<p>
We had high hope for staff-volunteer collaboration at that time. Indeed,
working with volunteers was explicitly written into the job description of the
web coordinator. We thought that, with RQ's creative and design skills, HXN's depth and breadth of Amnesty knowledge and contacts, and my formal
training in computer science and more than 15 years' research-and-development
and managerial experiences in the computer field, we had complementary skills
that made up a perfect team. HXN and I shared everything we had to bring
RQ up to speed.  We thought that we could establish a good example of how
staff and volunteers could work together as equal partners in accomplishing AIUSA's goals.
<p>
For a while things worked well. However, as time went on, I found it
increasingly difficult to work with RQ. He was often unresponsive to email
messages, for example. I got the impression that he wasn't managing email
messages at several accounts effectively. At other times, his communications
could be difficult to follow because his technical background was so weak. He
would sometimes imprecisely use, or misuse altogether, technical terms. He once
wrote to me that HXN and I shouldn't be "telneting" to the IGC account
during certain hours. This is quite different from what he meant to say, which
that we shouldn't run the web-page installation program at IGC during these
hours.
<p>
Much more seriously, I found that I couldn't take RQ's words at face
value. There were a number of things that happened that led me to this
conclusion, but let me just give you two examples. First, an issue arose over
setting up an internal password-protected area on the AIUSA website. HXN and
I were convinced that we first need to devise a plan for (1) identifying and
creating resources that volunteers need and (2) establishing a system for
authenticating a volunteer's identity and right to access the internal area.
Without consulting us, and in fact in contradiction to the 1996 Board decision
that specified that no internal documents be put on AIUSA website, RQ
announced to AIUSA members the creation of an internal area with a single
widely shared password. To preserve AIUSA's credibility, HXN and I were
forced to teach him how to set up such an area. RQ agreed that he'd take
down such an insecure internal area after a few months, but he never did.
<p>
(Incidentally, the sloppy security practice at AIUSA website was commented upon
on the international AI web developers' electronic mailing list.)
<p>
On a second occasion RQ's technical weakness and unreliability caused
major problems for AIUSA. In May 1997 he improperly changed AIUSA website's
domain registration. Until it was corrected, this mistake caused most of the
links to AIUSA web pages to break and many volunteers' email messages to be
misdirected. Reportedly, RXB asked him whether he had consulted with HXN and me beforehand. He said he had. That was false.
<p>
At the 1997 AGM, these difficulties were discussed with RQ and he agreed
with RXB, IXC, HXN, and I that he should consult IXC or me on all
technical matters and that he should let us know ahead of time his major plans
for the site. None of this happened. At the 1997 AGM, HXN and I sat down
with him to develop a plan through which much of the routine update tasks could
be distributed to AIUSA networks and structures. After returning from the AGM,
I asked him several times when we could move ahead with the plan. RQ
finally replied that, as AIUSA web coordinator, he could shelf, without our
consent, plans that we had previously developed. I consider RQ's behavior
here to have been unprofessional and unreliable. I decided that I was wasting
my valuable time with him, and that I was not going to work under such
conditions. Thus, I formally resigned from the team that was supposed to be
maintaining the AIUSA website. (My involvement had been diminishing because of
my frustration with RQ.)
<p>
Some people consider RQ's resignation tragic, <b>I think the real tragedy
happened when we gave up the hope that we could make a team where staff and
volunteers work collaboratively as equal partners on a common project.</b> Such
teamwork is not impossible. At the International Secretariat website, I am the
person responsible for creating and updating the document archive and I
organized the current system for updating the news archive and for posting news
services to amnesty-L, a mailing list with almost 5000 subscribers around the
world. IS staff, AI-Sweden staff, AI-Italy and AI-Canada volunteers and I work
collaboratively together on the IS website and amnesty-L mailing list. I was
even awarded a certificate of appreciation by the IS staff for my work. Why was
it then that the same collegial relationship failed to materialize for those of
us working at the AIUSA website? In my view, RQ&nbsp; has to take the
lion's share of the blame. The account given in his resignation letter was
self-serving and one-sided.
<p>
It appeared that the Board had RQ's resignation in mind when they adopted
Board decision 1998M4-ADG-2 (WEBSITE MANAGEMENT) which said that "The Board
decides that the final authority for deciding what material should or should
not appear on the AIUSA website and the selection, oversight and removal of web
resource persons resides in the Website Coordinator, subject to normal
processes of appeal." In support of the measure, the Board Minutes says
"Several express the view that web resource persons are like consultants or
other volunteers with discrete tasks (like assisting in a general mailing)". If
nothing else, these comments underscore the necessity of the Board to have
people on hand who can speak authoritatively about these issues. The comments,
of course, fundamentally misunderstand the role that volunteers like HXN and
I once played at the AIUSA website. We weren't assigned "discrete tasks." We
had management roles as evidenced by the fact that we had passwords to both of
the main AIUSA website locations at IGC and Maikon. In fact, we taught RQ
how to change passwords.
<p>
If the Board decides to persist in its decision, it would confirm for me that,
within AIUSA, I should not expect volunteers to play substantive roles in
decision making on projects where staff and volunteers work together. When a
conflict arises, irrespective of the actual facts around the conflict, the
staff will always have the final say. Thus the Board will be institutionalizing
a subordinate role for volunteers. This decision is in direct contradiction to
the staff/membership relation task force recommendations that staff and members
ought to be working in a co-equal, collaborative relationship.
<p>
All of this is troubling enough, but on top of this we have the Executive 
Director's memo,
appended below, which seeks to punish HXN for having, ostensibly, driven away RQ from his job.  This action adds injustice to the
tragedy.
<p>
HXN had made extraordinary contributions to AIUSA. Her work as CCWG
member, XXX, trainer, action-worker, death penalty
spokesperson and SIF respresentative is the equivalent of a half-time staff
member.  Put aside the $40,000 a year AIUSA would normally pay for such a staff
to do what HXN contributes for free. Put aside that she maintains excellent
relations with many AIUSA staff members and probably hundreds of volunteers.
No, none of this counts. the Executive Director has decreed that despite the positive
personal relationships HXN have with many staff, she must send all written 
communications through him or CG. How does this protect staff members
who need and want (and have continued) to communicate with HXN? (The fact
that I can append the Executive Director's memo in this message testifies to the sympathy that
staff members have for HXN.) Notably, the Executive Director did not say--*if* a staff member
have a problem with HXN, he or she can bring it to his attention. No, he
told staff that if HXN has the audacity to write to them, any email needs to
be forwarded directly to the Executive Director or CG.. Effectively the 
Executive Director is making HXN a
persona non grata.
This action is appalling. Where is the due process? Where is the independent
investigation of facts on all sides that human rights activists are continually
demanding that government carry out? That you could apparently accede to such
action boggles my mind. I urge you and the Board, in strongest terms, to
reconsider these actions. the Executive Director has exactly as much power as the Board
decides that he has. I urge that you grant HXN due process.
<p>
I got frustrated and discouraged by RQ's behavior. I became convinced that RQ could not act as a professional colleague and stopped my involvement
with AIUSA's web effort. HXN's problem was that she cared too much about AIUSA and continued to make comments while I walked away. One of 
HXN's
strengths, at times perhaps a weakness, is her attention to details. Many of us
have been the subject of her scrutiny. At times her critical comments make us
feel uncomfortable, but we recognize her selfless motivation to further
Amnesty's work. As professionals, we accept or reject her comments as
necessary. Unfortunately, such professionalism is apparently beyond RQ .
<p>
If this action by the Executive Director is maintained, I am afraid it will have convinced
me that AIUSA is not a human rights organization that I can, in good
conscience, continue to support either with my labor or my dollars. I will
continue to be involved in the Amnesty movement through affiliation with
another AI section and through my international collaborations, but, unless
the Executive Director's action is reversed, I will be forced to cancel my AIUSA membership and
never again to perform any task at the section level nor make comments on
section issues. If I speak on international AI forums, I will do so as a member
of another AI section.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Samson Tu
