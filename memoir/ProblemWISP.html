Dear RGB,
<p>
Thank you for calling me at work last week. I am sorry that we couldn't talk at that time. I am gravely concerned about the relationship between AIUSA ISP staff and the volunteer members of CCWG. Given the failure of the staff to take CCWG seriously, I am most dubious about my future participation in CCWG.  This letter identifies my specific concerns and suggestions for rectifying the situation, if that  is possible.
<p>
When RKM provided me the materials from the Board mailing  about AIUSA's Web site, I was not disturbed by the absence of my memos on AIUSA's WWW plan.  The possibility of including them was raised on the aiusa-ccwg mailing list, some objections were presented, and I accepted the decision not to include them. Rather, I was incensed that much of the materials submitted to the Board were never shared with CCWG, and the *considerable* efforts of the CCWG had no apparent bearing on the recommendations made to the Board.
<p>
The materials submitted to the Board were in four parts: 
<p>
1. a discussion on WWW issues that Howard Schreier drafted (those  issues were discussed on the aiusa-ccwg mailing list), 
<p>
2. results of a poll that you sent to various units of AIUSA, 
<p>
3. a short memo from GG recommending that a committee be  formed to examine issues involved in an AIUSA WWW site, and 
<p>
4. an unsigned appendix arguing that AIUSA should develop an in-house  web site. 
<p>
5. an appendix enumerating Amnesty-related web sites obtained from a search on Yahoo.
<p>
The last four items were not made available to members of the CCWG before RKM showed them to me.  This is only one instance of a on-going pattern of ISP staff choosing not to communicate with the computer professionals who volunteer their time with the CCWG.
<p>
I value the input of staff.  Before I agreed to prepare the memo that outlined issues concerning the AIUSA WWW home page and that proposed a tentative plan of action, I asked for your and ISC's active participation (and you agreed to it, see the message appended below). 
<p>
Yet I did not receive a single comment from you in response to the five drafts I made available to anyone on the aiusa-ccwg mailing list over a three-month period.  You had *ample*  opportunity to let CCWG as a whole know about your preference for an in-house web site.  We had assumed that because the ISP staff is already overworked, it would be best for AIUSA to let a third-party internet hosting service provide much of the infrastructure necessary for developing an AIUSA web presence.  Not once did you write one sentence to lead me to believe you had any other plan in mind.
<p>
Had you taken the time to fulfill your promise to participate in drafting the memo over which I  and other CCWG members labored for three months, the document would have included considerably different and more relevant content. 
<p>
CCWG members agree that having an in-house site would confer tremendous benefits.  We might disagree on timing and priority, but we never had  the opportunity to discuss it, because you never once introduced the issue. By its founding resolution (AGM 1995), CCWG is charged with the responsibility to advise the Board on computer communication issues. Your decision to bypass CCWG and to send the recommendation directly to the Board violates the spirit of the resolution, given your knowledge of CCWG's interest in this issue.
<p>
I was deeply disappointed to learn that GG has  recommended to the Board that a staff/volunteer committee be formed to examine WWW issues.  In the face of your failure to comment on, let  alone participate in, the CCWG's attempt to examine just those issues,  I can only conclude that such a committee would be a colossal waste of  volunteer time.  As such, I would not be willing to participate.  I  have alerted RKM to my opinion, in the hope that she will bring that opinion to the Board in its meeting later this week.
<p>
The SPiT/MAT reports recognized the importance of developing a computer communication infrastructure for AIUSA, and gave CCWG specific assignments for creating such an infrastructure. Moreover, the AIUSA Board, in its meeting last fall, adopted a resolution which would "Forward oversight responsibility for this issue [of developing Amnesty International's use of Information Technology] to the Computer Communications Working Group (CCWG) in collaboration with the appropriate deputy executive directors." Yet, not knowing the activities and plans of the ISP staff, the CCWG works blindly, resulting in tremendous waste of volunteer time and energy.  Had DXH known of your recommendation to budget for the establishment of an in-house Web site next year, he would not have to spent time researching alternative internet hosting services and the criteria for choosing among them.  HXN  and others working on  the prototype AIUSA web pages would have benefited from seeing the  results of your survey of AIUSA units. (You neither described the survey plan nor shared the survey results with CCWG members.)  I consider much of the time I spent working on the WWW memo wasted, because it is not what it could have been if I had received extremely modest input from you during the drafting of the document.
<p>
The current relationship between CCWG and the ISP staff is no longer acceptable to me.  As a research scientist at a major university, I  have too many other responsibilities and opportunities for volunteer work to allow my time to be squandered.  I see no place for  me on the CCWG unless major changes are made.
<p>
As a first step toward creating meaningful working relationship between CCWG and staff, I propose the following:
<p>
1.  At least twice a year the ISP staff should prepare a memo for CCWG describing staff activities and plans related to computer communication for the  next six months.  At the same time, the CCWG should prepare a similar  memo for circulation among staff and for distribution to the Board and membership through appropriate channels.
<p>
2.  By AGM resolution, the CCWG is responsible for advising the Board  on computer communications issues. Thus, all materials related to computer communications to be included in Board mailings should be made available to CCWG members at least two weeks before the submission deadline. The volunteer members of CCWG should similarly consult staff before making any recommendation to the Board. 
<p>
3. The CCWG should institute a decision-making procedure wherein CCWG  members (both volunteer and ex officio members such as you, ISC, and HXN) are required to vote, within a specified period of time, on motions proposed and seconded by  CCWG members. 
<p>
4.  Leaders for all projects in the CCWG's work plan should brief and  be briefed by the staff persons whose responsibilities overlap with the  project.  For example, HXN, who has been providing and overseeing e-mail servicing of members and the public for the last four years (which GG's memo failed to acknowledge), should be informed when the Development Office considers establishing e-mail servicing.  She should not be informed  after the fact.  Whenever a CCWG project is initiated, the appropriate  staff contact should be identified.  For this purpose, CCWG members should be immediately issued phone cards that allow them to make  long-distance calls on AIUSA business. 
<p>
We can discuss these proposals either electronically or on another CCWG conference call. I am carbon copying this message to all members of  CCWG so that we can decide collectively whether such changes are desirable.
<p>
I look forward to your prompt response to this message.  Please copy  DW also. If you like, you can give me a call me at 408-249-2447 Thursday April 11 between 10 AM and 10:30 AM EDT. If that time is not convenient for you, you can call me at work (415-725-3391).
<p>
Thank you for your attention to my concerns.
<p>
Sincerely,<p>
