Hi PGM,
<p>
Thank you for your recent messages.
<p>
...
<p>
In a previous message you asked that I and other CCWG members communicate with you through RGG and HAS, your designated staff/CCWG contacts. By your direct messages to me, I hope you are indicating that this arrangement is no longer necessary. I believe that AIUSA's Internet presence would benefit with improved cooperation and communication between us (you and CCWG/RG members).
<p>
In a message dated Tue, 10 Oct 1995, that HNX sent to you and carbon copied
me, you were quoted as saying
<p>
>  Our site will be a simple site for ai<br>
> pubs and merchandise...as the larger organizational site develops,<br>
> we will be incorporated into such.
<p>
Now is the time to coordinate the PluggedIn site with the AIUSA WWW pages at IGC. We should coordinate our content materials, our links, and possibly our look. For example, at IGC we have a more comprehensive and better-tested listing of various AIUSA-related WWW sites in the U.S. There is no need for you to maintain your own. (We will be asking the IS to maintain the international links.) . We represent the same organization. We have the obligation to produce a coordinated muliti-site WWW presence that carries a consistent message. Can I suggest that we (you and CCWG members) start afresh on new terms, where we collaborate and cooperate, and answer each other's requests and questions quickly and satisfactorily? I hope you are coming to the AGM, where we can discuss issues related AIUSA WWW development.. I know you are dedicated to this organization and its goals; I have every reason to believe that we will be able to work together to further the interests of AIUSA.
<p>
