Subject: Re: 9/29 Board Committee meeting 
<p>
Dear FWG,
<p>
I had agreed to explain my behavior at the 9/29 Board
International Committee meeting, where I choked and walked out of
the meeting. If you still think a phone call is necessary, I can
be reached at 415-725-3391 during the day. 
<p>
First let me drop the pretense that I resigned from CCWG to tend
my own garden. No, I quit because I became very disenchanted with
AIUSA at the section level, and decided that I can better use my
time by not holding any responsible position within AIUSA.
Instead, I want to freelance on projects of my own choosing and to
work with people whom I like and respect. 
<p>
I had heard complaints about staff-volunteer relationship before.
My own experience serving on CCWG indicated that, while there are
a number of dedicated and caring individuals at the national
level, a few staff member can be capable of rudeness and
insensitivity that I haven't experienced anywhere else. Here I am
not talking about phone calls and messages not returned, but about
having my honesty questioned (he apologized later) and about
having ethnic joke thrown at me. (Somehow a staff member thought
it was funny to call the street where I live, Coolidge Drive,
"Coolie Drive." I thought I didn't hear right, then that person
said "In Amnesty, we are allowed to joke." I was just too stunned
to respond.) A current volunteer who worked as a staff person told
me that, among the staff, certain volunteer leader was disliked,
and that if I identify too closely with that person, I may be seen
as that person's "toady." (Later another staff person confirmed to
me that indeed that volunteer leader was unpopular among staff.) I
would not believe that this kind of things is possible within
AIUSA had I not experieced them personally. 
<p>
[<i>2002/02/11 comment on &quot;Coolie Drive&quot;: <swt@leland.stanford.edu> In retrospect, I probably should have reported this incident to the national
organization. Without having the organization resolve the issue in some way,
AIUSA became diminished in my eyes. Since then, whenever I see this staff 
member's name, I always remember this incident, and cannot respect her for the 
good work she may be doing</i><swt@leland.stanford.edu>]<p>
For an organization that has a volunteer base since its inception,
I was surprised to find that apparently some staff really don't
know what role volunteers can play in AIUSA. You may recall the
fuss I raised in April over the Board mailing. I was absolutely
livid over the way the work of CCWG was completely ignored in that mailing. 
Since then GLX has been remarkable cooperative
and responsive with regard to CCWG, and I'd like to commend her
for that. However, why did it take my outraged protest to bring
about this turnaround? A third party told me that when she started
working for AIUSA, she didn't realize that she may be working with
volunteers. When I was doing email servicing on aiaction, I had to
call upon staff to satisfy the needs of the public and of our
members. Some, like HG, went out of their way to help,
but on a couple occasions, I also got responses that suggested
that the staff person didn't recognize that volunteers are
servicing the public through the aiaction account.
<p>
Finally, you are aware of the problems that exist between PM and members of CCWG. I carbon copied you on the message
about the inappropriate materials that appeared on the Publication
Unit's website. Subsequently, I appealed to him for cooperation
and collaboration in coordinating AIUSA's two websites, one at
PluggedIn and the other at IGC. My appeal was flatly refused, and
he indicated that I, like other CCWG members, should communicate
with him only through a third party. Before the AGM, I appealed to GG, asking that PM be present at the AGM so that
we can work out our differences face-to-face. PM apparently
had some conflict and, at the AGM CCWG meeting, GG basically
affirmed the status quo: we should communicate with PM only
through an appointed individual. (JP volunteered for
the thankless job.)
<p>
I understand that PM is a unique case. Still, I was deeply disappointed by the 
way things were handled. I came to believe that GG is not the kind of manager who would can a
problem, seek out the root cause of the problem, hear all sides
impartially, and try to work out a creative solution. I lost the
faith that I can go to him to seek satisfactory solutions on
issues related to computer communication and staff-volunteer
relationship. My subsequent encounters with have not changed my
assessment. The status quo, where the people maintaining AIUSA's
two websites don't talk to each other, is just too pitiful to see
in an organization.
<p>
At the June AGM, I decided that I don't want to deal with all of
these bizarre organizational and personnel problems at AIUSA. I
don't want to feel that I should be reponsible for pushing for any
change. Therefore I resigned from CCWG. I will be *very* reluctant
to hold any position within AIUSA at the section level.
<p>
There are certainly enough things for me to do as a freelance
volunteer. In contrast to AIUSA, I found people at IS to be a
pleasure to work with. Currently, I am looking after amnesty-L,
the AI news release mailing list, and I am working on the project
to make external documents available at the amnesty.org website.
In general, even though my loyalty to AIUSA is diminished greatly,
my work for Amnesty continues to be sustained by my admiration and
respect for individuals such as HXH, RKM, AA, JG,
and others. I will continue to take up projects for the Western
Region because CT and JXB are people I like and
respect. (Yesterday I just gave a talk to Western Region Cogroupers on how to do research on Internet.) I told you that I'd
be willing to help with any AIUSA/AI-Taiwan collaboration not
because I think AIUSA will gain any benefit from it, but because
of my friendship with DT, the Executive Director of
AI-Taiwan. 
<p>
Let's me come back to the Committee Meeting on September 29. While
I appreciate the recognition that Board members gave to me and
HXN on the work we are doing, I also felt a bit sad because I
no longer take great pride in AIUSA. Emotions started to swell
when I heard a Board member saying that AIUSA can take credit because of
the work I am doing for IS on external document conversion. Indeed
AIUSA can take credit for alienating one of its volunteers so that
he'd rather work for the IS, not AIUSA. (It will be difficult for
me to comply with DS request that I try to estimate the
value of my contributions. When I work on the IS web project, I
don't consider myself working for AIUSA at all.)
<p>
At the meeting, HXN proposed some detailed steps to ensure that
the new-hired AIUSA web coordinator talk to members of CCWG and
build a good working relationship with CCWG. GG's response was
that *of course* people will talk to each other. At that point I
got angry and reminded him that, with his consent, people
maintaining the two AIUSA websites are not talking to each other.
I was reminded of the wounds and disappointments over the last
year, and had to walk out of the meeting.
<p>
In fairness, I must mention staff members who had helped me along
the way. As I said, GLX's turnaround was remarkable. I
always have had good relation with IXC, who'd call me up to make
sure that what I requested was actually implemented. JC was unfailingly responsive. HG returned my
calls promptly and at one time went out of her way to satisfy the request of
an Amnesty trekkie fan. (I took special satisfaction in helping to
service the request of this trekkie fan because she said she was
the lone AI supporter among her Southern military family members.)
<p>
This is not a constructive letter. I have no special suggestion on
steps to take to fix some of the problems. Frankly, I don't want
to think about them anymore. There is enough work to be done
without getting entangled in these organizational matters.
<p>
Samson
