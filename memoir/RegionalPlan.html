Re: Response to RPG questionnaire <br>

Dear NXH,
<p>
It was good to hear from you. Here is my response to the questionnaire that you asked me to consider from the perspective of computer communication issues. I had circulated a draft of this document among AIUSA CCWG members, and got comments from Hilary Naylor in particular. 
<p>
>1. Which major goals, priorities, and concerns should guide our 3-year<br>
>Western Region planning process? Please bear in mind that these should<br>
>acknowledge the spirit and recommendations of the MAT report approved last<br>
>year by the Board of AIUSA.
<p>
The central theme of the MAT report was the rejuvenation of volunteer and membership activism. It recommended systemic and specific changes aimed at streamlining AI office operations, integrate student and local group servicing, and giving volunteers the tools and support needed in their work. Computer communication, in particular, was considered an important tool for overcoming "many of the information and organizational barriers facing AIUSA groups, volunteers, and staff" (p. 10, MAT Report). With the explosion of Internet activities in recent years, and especially with the current effort to wire all schools (e.g., Netday effort in California), the development of an effective computer communication infrastructure among our widely dispersed membership should be a major goal of the Western Region in the next three years. We suggest the Western Region Planning Group consider the following tasks:
<p>
A. Develop a network of electronic mailing lists covering the Western Region.
<p>
Numerous AI groups (e.g., Group 19, Stanford group) already use electronic mailing lists to distribute information among group members. In the S.F. Bay area, we have an area-wide mailing list (aiusa-ncal) that link most local groups, campus groups, volunteer leaders, and many high school groups. I believe that Western Region can and should pioneer a system of mailing lists designed to organize quick action responses, to make it easy to provide interim information updates, and to distribute regional information.  Joe Baker, Hilary Naylor, and I had discussed the creation of a hierarchical system, divided between a geographical and functional components. The geographical part requires that we recruit volunteers to manage *area* mailing lists like aiusa-ncal (e.g., aiusa-scal, aiusa-seattle). These area mailing lists should be included in the higher-level mailing list (e.g., aiusa-wr). The higher-level mailing list should contain the nested lists and those members who are not covered by any local lists (e.g., those Eastern Sierra folks not in a local mailing list of their own).  
<p>
Every electronically connected AI activists (and possibly staff) should be in the geography-based lists. In vast majority of cases, people should be in exactly one list--the geographically most restrictive one (e.g., I will be in aiusa-ncal, but not in aiusa-wr explicitly). Thus, to reach people in a geographical region, nobody should have to send out the message to more than one list. This way, the administrative duties are distributed among a hierarchy of list maintainers. In the extreme case, the top-level administrator only manages lists, not a single individual address.
<p>
In this system, the functional component (i.e., mailings lists based on the roles people play, e.g., aiusa-ccwg and AC mailing lists) provides a separate layer. Once everyone is in some geographical list, no message should be posted to both functional and geographical lists. The whole design is oriented toward avoiding cross postings and distribution of administrative responsibilities. 
<p>
B.  Make electronic communication an integral part of servicing members and the public
<p>
With increasing number of AIUSA members, groups, and the public connected by the Internet, the need to provide AI services on-line will increase.  More groups and volunteers will want to communicate with volunteer leaders and regional offices by electronic mail.  This means that volunteer leaders and office personnel (both staff and volunteers) should be empowered to handle electronic communication. Western Region should institute a program where (1) office personnel are given appropriate resources (time, hardware, software, and training) and responsibility (job description, recognition) to handle on-line servicing of members and groups, (2) volunteer leaders should be given the resources (e.g., Peacenet accounts, and when appropriate, softwares) and support for them to become effective users of computer-communication tools. 
<p>
The regional offices, together with the Membership Service Department, AIUSA CCWG, and groups with on-line presence should collaborate to create a public servicing system that is institutionalized, in the sense that servicing must be carried out in a way that assures continuity (i.e., it should not be a situation in which an office's response mechanism fails because one person is away) and systematic, in the sense that all of the AIUSA entities that service inquires from the public and membership should be aware of the roles they play and the capabilities and limitations of each servicing entities. Volunteers who create their own Amnesty-related home pages on the Web are already finding that they are getting inquiries about Amnesty from the general public. The regional offices should be prepared to back them up with information and assistance. Regional offices receive inquiries (most on phones currently) all the time, and are the one part of the organization currently tasked with finding answers to general inquiries. Most of the requests we receive for country information can be handled by an office volunteer who pulls information from our files of all IS information.  
<p>
C.  Create an on-line AI information repository
<p>
One way to reduce the need for servicing is to make information readily and widely accessible. I understand that Sunil Gupta is already creating an on-line index of the UAs that the SF office receives. With the increasing need to service on-line inquiries, such electronic filing system should be institutionalized. With the IS and AIUSA considering adopting Lotus Notes, the leading groupware system that has some new Internet-access features. If such a system is adopted by AIUSA, there may be substantial changes in the way documents are created and distributed. Western Region staff and personnel should be alert to such development.  If that happens, the possibility of sharing AI information among volunteer activists on the net become a tantalizing possibility.
<p>
>2. Our discussions will include a broad evaluation of our current regional<br>
>programs and structures; which criteria do you recommend we use to draw<br>
>useful conclusions from an evaluation of the program or network that you<br>
>represent?
<p>
The development of computer communication infrastructure can be evaluated along quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Along quantitative dimension, we can look at the number and percentage of groups, ACs, SACs, and other volunteer leaders linked up by electronic networks. We can look at savings in postal and paper usage, if any, and measure the time required for the dissemination of certain information to the grassroots level. Along the qualitative dimension, we can look at the work flow and work load of support staff and volunteer leaders to understand the impact of computer communication technology.
<p>
>3. Are there any major projects or initiatives for the next fiscal year that<br>
>you would like to present to the April meeting?
<p>
How about the Western Region electronic-mail network (see #1)? Does it require presentation in person? Much details remain to be worked out, including how such mailing list system should be established and maintained, the relationship of such mailing list system to the new activist database, and the role of ACs and SACs in recruiting for such a system.
<p>
>4. What preliminary recommendations do you have to improve both the media<br>
>and fundraising potential of our current programs and events?
<p>
Almost two years ago, RXM posted a strategy paper on Peacenet. She wrote, "Imagine, however, that we have a volunteer in most local groups (a 'media coordinator') who is responsible for the local newspapers, daily, and weekly, large and small....In the top media markets, imagine that we have a media-savvy volunteer called a 'media-market coordinator.' A media-market coordinator would (a) divvy up the local media to the closest and/or strongest groups, (b) track contacts in local media, (c ) provide advice on media strategies, and (d) be available in the evening for consultation on press releases written by volunteers."  RXM went on to describe a system where the media coordinators are connected by electronic mail and are activated in a human rights crises. The system RXM described was partially implemented when she created the medialist network. However, the idea of media-market coordinator who directs on-going maintenance of media contact information and who are available for consultation remain unrealized. For country expertise local groups can turn to country co-groups. A similar system of area-wide media experts should improve the media potential of our current programs and events.
<p>
For two years, members of SF Bay Area Major Gifts Pilot Project worked hard to develop contacts and organize events oriented toward major donors. The team came to the conclusion that the effort can only be continued with the addition of AIUSA administrative staff support. I am sure some members of the Regional Planning Group are familiar with Major Gifts Pilot Project, and will be able to elaborate on its implication for regional planning much better than I can. ( I wasn't involved in it.)
