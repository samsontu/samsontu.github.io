Dear Jim,
<p>
Thanks for mailing the MAT proposal to me. It arrived just before I left for a week-long conference. I was not able to make copies and share it with other Group 19 members as I promised. However, the long plane ride back from Canada gave me the luxury of responding in detail to the MAT proposal. The other side of the coin is that I have no chance to discuss the ideas outlined below with anyone else. Thus, please be forgiving if they sound outrageous or impractical.  These are the rant and raving of a relative novice in AIUSA. (I am not even eligible for a 5-year lapel pin.)
<p>
I am very impressed with the proposal.  It calls for the regional offices to return to the field organizing model that was supposed to be effective in cultivating grassroots activism.  It has many excellent suggestions on how to make activists more effective. The proposal, however, scarcely touches on the fact that the technological basis for communication in the late 90s is vastly different from that available in the 70s and early 80s.  The availability of emails and conferences has created avenues of information flow that didn't exist before. (For example, I don't think I'd heard about the MAT report at all without my electronic connections.)  I hope the MAT proposal can systematically consider how the capabilities of computer communication (that is becoming increasingly prevalent) help AIUSA achieving many of the goals enumerated in the MAT proposal. 
<p>
Imagine that AIUSA has a well-organized and password-protected ftp/gopher/WWW archive of internal training materials, campaign materials, publication materials that volunteers from all over the country (or around the world) can contribute to and download from. Imagine that we have mailing list circles that tie together those groups and individuals that are working on common tasks or are close together geographically.  With such infrastructure in place, let's look at some of the problems that MAT wishes to address in the re-organization of AIUSA.
<ol>
<li>1. AIUSA overburdens groups with too many actions and too much paper? Well, just tell the groups what are available, and interested groups can download what they want from the archive.
<li>
2. Group lacks tight coordination and communication? The email distribution lists should help coordination and communication. 

3 Groups are isolated through lack of contact? The email distribution list can help groups to break the isolation.  MAT proposal calls for the ACs to contact the groups at least monthly. Electronic mail is a great tool for maintaining contact among geographically dispersed groups.
<li>
4. AIUSA recruits new members sporadically?  In addition to the recruitment ideas enumerated in the MAT proposal, we should recruit aggressively in the cyberspace.  Not only will this medium help us reach people whom we may miss with other techniques, the members recruited through this medium will help groups upgrade their technological capability.  Group 19 has fair success in making its presence known to those in the S.F. Bay area interested in Amnesty.  Most of the people on our electronic newsletter mailing list are recruited through the Internet.
<li>
5. AIUSA provides insufficient and inconsistent materials and training?  All groups that have Internet access can download everything from the ftp/gopher/WWW archive.
<li>
6. AIUSA invests unequally in different regions and sectors?  The availability of the on-line archive material should help to equalize the difference.
</ol><p>
I am not claiming that we can solve Amnesty problems by blind application of technology.  Many groups are not ready to take advantage of computer communication.  If we are not careful, it is possible that technology can exacerbate some of the inequalities that already exist among groups.  Nevertheless, we should recognize digitization of information as the direction we want to go. We probably will be going in that direction no matter what.  If we plan for the changes carefully, I believe that there is a match between the capabilities of new technology and the needs of Amnesty as outlined in the MAT proposal. At the time when the organization examines and reinvents its work process, it should plan for the use of technology to streamline its flow of information.  Not to do so is to miss a golden opportunity.
<p>
I don't know how much time and money you spent mailing out the MAT proposal. If we had an on-line archive where you could deposit the proposal (using one or several of the common formats), I could have retrieved it myself.  I don't know how much staff time is spent sending out documents. If these documents could be searched and retrieved by individuals or groups that need them, how much staff time will be saved?  In various parts of the MAT proposal, you call for creating bright graphical materials.  Creating such material from scratch is expensive and time consuming.  Yet Shawn Giese has put together a large collection of activist graphical images that we cannot distribute easily.
<p>
I suggest:
<p>
Systemic changes:
<ul><li>
AIUSA considers how to evolve into an organization where the creation, transmission, and storage of its information resources are consistent with the requirements of electronic communication.
<li>
AIUSA develops models of using information technology its internal and external communication and coordination.
</ul>
<p>
Specific changes:
<ul>
<li>5.1 Recruitment: Post announcements of Amnesty group activities on Internet on regular basis
<li>
8.1 Recruitment: Develop attractive public recruitment WWW pages on Internet
<li>
16.1 Local and student groups: Make survey of groups' access to Internet resources and tools (email, ftp, gopher, WWW)
<li>
20. ACs and SACs: Make computer literacy part of AC and SAC training
<li>
27.1. Resource Delivery: Investigate the feasibility of password-protected internal ftp/gopher/WWW Amnesty resource archive
<li>
28. Communication: ......Make MM and Amnesty available on line in one or several of the common formats (e.g., DOS or Mac Word, WordPerfect)
<li>
33.1  Communication: Develop policy and procedure for establishing internal AIUSA mailing lists
<li>
33.2 Examine the work practices within the organization to see how information flow may be digitized.
<li>
33.3 Support pilot projects (such the ones Rena Margulis suggested) that use electronic communication to coordinate nation-wide media and legislative actions.
</ul>
<p>
A couple of thoughts on non-computer issues: (1) perhaps it is taken for granted, but I strongly urge that the due-paying members of AIUSA be informed of the reorganization plan and the implementation progress; (2) nothing in the proposal leads me to believe that at the end of the reorganization, AIUSA will be more diverse culturally. 
<p>
This is all I have to say.
<pl>

Sincerely,
