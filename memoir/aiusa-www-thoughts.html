<p>The purpose of the document is to explore some of the issues involved
n developing the presence of AIUSA on the World Wide Web. At the end of
the document, I present some thoughts on a possible plan of actions. The
ideas presented here do NOT represent the position of AIUSA CCWG. I am
not even sure that all members of CCWG have read earlier drafts of the
document. I alone is responsible for any outrageous statement made here.</p>

<p>This document should be read in conjunction with my notes on the discussions
that AIUSA CCWG/RG had on similar issues. Click <a HREF="aiusa-www-disc.html">here</a>

<h2><a   NAME="goals">Goals</a></h2>

<p>Since its beginning in 1993, the WWW technology has taken the Internet
by storm. It is clear that, together with electronic mail, the Web or its
successor will become the dominant forms of information exchange on the
Internet. It has already become a popular method for advertising and information
dissemination. With its integration of information source, electronic mail,
and fill-in forms, Web can generate actions for cases and campaigns. With
the development and standardization of authentication mechanisms and secure
data transmission, monetary transaction on the net will blossom. It will
be possible to sell AI merchandise and to recruit due-paying members on-line.
In fact, as general programming and scripting become easier on the Web,
it will be the net-based user-interface of choice for many types of applications.
</p>

<p>The Web has several characteristics that make it a very attractive for
an organization like AIUSA. First, its distributed nature matches the dispersed
locations of AIUSA membership and volunteers. Anyone with access to the
Web from anywhere can access the same information. The multiplatform nature
of Web browsers solves the problem with diverse hardwares used by AIUSA
members. The point-and-click interface of Web browsers is intuitive enough
for technophobs to use. Finally, AIUSA can take advantage of the information
management and security features that are sure to emerge. </p>

<p>In addition to its use as tools for publicity and information dissemination,
the Web holds the potential to revolutionize AIUSA's internal information
management. Imagine an on-line repository of case work tools (e.g, the
Casework Manual and country information) that an action file coordinator
can search and browse; imagine a searchable and indexed archive of documents
issued by the IS (which our hard-working Peacenet coordinator currently
sends out by e-mail upon request); imagine a Web-based interface that allow
authorized staff and volunteers to access and update our activists database;
imagine being able to collaborate with colleagues across the net to develop
this on-line repository of Amnesty information. Much of the (wo)manpower
that currently goes into organizing, maintaining, and distributing information
in the section can be freed up for other tasks if the information management
is done once and made available to all. More and more companies are linking
information management tools to the Web. For example, Lotus Notes, one
of the most popular groupware products, will allow Web users to access
Notes databases soon. In the not too distant future, the Web or its descendants
will be the universal interface through which geographically dispersed
organization like Amnesty access and manage information. </p>

<p>In summery, here some possible goals for developing AIUSA's WWW presence
WWW can be </p>

<ol>
<li>a publishing tool: in cooperation with the IS and other AI sections,
we can use the Web page to present Amnesty information, promote HR awareness,
and service inquiries about Amnesty </li>

<li>an action-generating tool </li>

<li>a recruiting tool: bringing in (3a) volunteers for local groups and
action networks and (3b) donor members </li>

<li>a merchandising tool </li>

<li>a collaborating tool for volunteers and staff across the net </li>

<li>a repository for resources useful in AI's work </li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to these functional goals, the AIUSA WWW home page should
also have the (7) coordinative goal of bringing together all of the home
pages being developed by members of AIUSA </p>

<p>To enumerate the goals is to realize that we are talking a long-term,
multi-staged project that need to involve both staff and volunteers. There
is no way that we can realize the potentials of the WWW all at once. Neither
the staff nor volunteers alone have all of the necessary skills, resources,
and access to information. Furthermore, some of the technologies are not
mature yet. Nevertheless it is useful to enumerate the possibilities at
the planning stage, as our long-term goals may affect the short-term choices
we make. </p>

<h2><a   NAME="stages">Phases of Development</a></h2>

<p>Given the multiplicity of goals, rapidly changing technology, and limited
resources, how can we generate a coherent development plan? I submit that
we should examine the requirements of each goal, the resources we have,
and the internal and external constraints that we face, then try to sort
the goals so that we achieve the easy ones (those with least constraints
and whose requirements we can satisfy with current resources) first, and
then, over time, develop the resources and remove constraints so that the
other goals can be met. </p>

<p>Requirements of goals (1), (2), (3a) (7): </p>

<ol>
<li>A web site that has sufficient disk space, stable and fast server,
good technical support, reasonable price, remote administration of the
web pages from across the country, support of forms and cgi scripts. </li>

<li>A group of volunteers and staff who have the requisite skills and are
committed to maintain the web pages so that the information and action
requests are accurate, up-to-date, and attractively presented. </li>

<li>A servicing system that handles the inevitable electronic traffic that
will be generated from enhanced presence of AIUSA on Internet </li>

<li>A clear division of responsibilities among different AI web sites and
different part of AIUSA, and mechanisms that allow them to develop and
update their parts of the Web pages. </li>

<li>For the ultimate success of the web site, staff and volunteer creativity
and participation in enhancing the information value of the site </li>

<li>For coordination and action-generation purposes, a mailing list of
AIUSA web site, mailing lists, bboard maintainers. </li>
</ol>

<p>Requirements of goals (3b), (4) </p>

<ol>
<li>A good web site as above </li>

<li>Staff members in the AIUSA membership and merchandising departments
trained and budgeted to process membership registration and merchandising
on the Internet. </li>

<li>A commonly accepted standard for secure transmission of financial information
and support of such a standard by the Internet service provider that AIUSA
uses. </li>
</ol>

<p>Requirements of goals (5) </p>

<ol>
<li>A security system that protects the internal and working documents
</li>

<li>Groups of AIUSA members who are willing to experiment with on-line
collaboration </li>

<li>A good web site as above (without the need for financial transactions)
</li>
</ol>

<p>Requirements of goal (6) </p>

<ol>
<li>A good web site as above (without the need for financial transactions)
</li>

<li>A security system that properly segregates the documents and files
so that only people with appropriate authorizations have access </li>

<li>Preferably, advanced information management tools (e.g., data and document
management systems, version control tools, etc.) </li>

<li>Proper coordination with the IS and with other AI sections, as Internet
resources are potentially accessible from all over the world </li>

<li>Sufficient number of AIUSA members who can be contributors to the Web
resource repository or make use of the repository </li>
</ol>

<p>What resources do we have now? Here is a partial list. </p>

<ol>
<li>CCWG/RG, although only a handful of people are truly active </li>

<li>A small group of people willing to service the aiaction account </li>

<li>A similar small group of people working to develop a set of servicing
FAQs </li>

<li>Numerous Web pages set up by members of AIUSA </li>

<li>The interest and hard work of some staff members (e.g., Patrick Mingus,
who has set up a Web page for the Publication Department of AIUSA) </li>

<li>The support of the Board of AIUSA </li>
</ol>

<p>External constraints that we need to be mindful of: </p>

<ol>
<li>Rapidly evolving Web technology (incompatible browsers, e.g., Netscape
extensions, evolving security mechanisms, arrival of Java technology, etc.
etc.) </li>

<li>Lack of standard for making financial transactions on the net (although
it is possible to supplement the net with 800 numbers). MasterCard and
Visa have agreed to create a joint standard, but the standard still needs
to be finalized and softwares incorporating the standard have not appeared
yet. </li>

<li>Evolving plans at the IS level. I understand that they will be putting
up a host on the Internet and that there is discussion about adopting some
groupware package for the movement. Beyond that, I hardly knows anything
about what they are doing. I wish there is more information flow between
the international CCWG and AIUSA CCWG </li>
</ol>

<p>Internal constraints that we should either respect or try to overcome
eventually: </p>

<ol>
<li>AIUSA is mostly an organization of volunteers. We cannot impose any
organizational imperative. On the other hand, it is a source of strength
as well. </li>

<li>Most of our volunteers are still not connected to the net and there
is wide disparity in skill levels </li>

<li>Many of the current staff did not come to the job with prior training
in computer communication </li>

<li>There is currently no organizational standard or requirement on the
use of computer communication as integral part of AIUSA's communication
infrastructure </li>
</ol>

<p>If we look at the requirements and resources, we see that the requirements
of goal 5 (the web as a collaborating tool for volunteers and staff across
the net) are met by the resources we already have. That is not surprising,
since this very document is being constructed as a collaboration among
CCWG/RG members. Among the remaining sets of goals, we have met many of
requirements of the first one (goals 1, 2, 3(a) and 7) to some degree,
whereas meeting goals 3(b), 4, and 6 require developments beyond AIUSA's
control. </p>

<p>This configuration of requirements, resources, and constraints suggests
a three-phased development process where (1) the first phase concentrates
on those goals whose requirements are mostly organizational and involve
no technological advances or standardization beyond our control (publication
and coordination of Internet-based information, i.e., reaching goals 1,
2, 3a, and 7), (2) the second phase concentrates on goals that that require
the development of standard mechanisms for on-line financial transactions
(generation of revenues, i.e., reaching goals 3b and 4), and (3) the third
phase concentrates on goals that require the development of a security
model in coordination with IS and other sections (establishing a net-based
internal information and action resource repository). </p>

<p>Goal 5, development of network-wide collaboration models, should be
something that we continuously try to accomplish throughout the whole development
process. </p>

<p>The security and finance issues involved in Phase Two and Phase Three
developments are still murky at this stage. We will present some preliminary
discussions in the appendices. </p>

<p>This division into three phases suggests that we should initially concentrate
on a Web site that inform and educate the public, recruit volunteers, and
coordinate sites developed by AIUSA members. At the same time, we should
be mindful of the goals in the other two phases. We should keep track of
innovations that impact the other phases, and we certainly need to pay
close attention to developments in establishing standards for Internet
commerce and security. We need to establish dialog with various parts of
AIUSA that will be affected by the proposed Phase Two and Phase Three developments,
and with the IS and the international CCWG. We need to identify and overcome
internal obstacles (e.g., training of staff and development of procedures
to handle on-line acquisition of donor members). We need to develop a comprehensive
plan for the later phases as we implement the first phase. </p>

<p>The rest of the documents (1) looks further into issues involved in
Phase One (Section 2), and (2) suggests a plan of action (Section 3). Issues
related to Phase Two and Three are relegated to appendices. </p>

<h2><a   NAME="plan">A Possible Plan of Actions</a></h2>

<p>Based in part on the discussions on the CCWG/RG mailing list and the
ideas presented in this document, I would like to suggest, as a straw man
to be revised and refined, a concrete plan of actions. The plan divides
the work for Phase I of into two periods: first six months and first year.
Phase II and III, which involve security and financial-transactions, are
relegated to the future. The plan is divided a number of discrete tasks.
If something like the plan is approved, the tasks should be assigned in
different individuals with clear deadlines for completion of the tasks.
If we can accomplish all of the Phase I tasks in one year, we would have
made significant progress. </p>

<h3>A. First Six Months</h3>

<p>In the following, I asserted a very demanding agenda for the first six
months. The idea is to create goals that we can aim for. If we can't accomplish
everything within the time frame, then some of the task can be pushed to
the first-year stage. </p>

<h4>Content Development</h4>

<p>A1: Assemble a team of volunteers interested in creating content for
the AIUSA Web page. </p>

<p>A2: Create a &quot;vision in action&quot; web site for the April Board
meeting and for demonstration at the June AGM. A &quot;vision in action&quot;
is a demonstration prototype that illustrate the potentials and desired
functionalities of a system. We can create the initial content of the AIUSA
web site by cannibalizing existing Amnesty pages. Hilary Naylor has already
taken Catherine's Human Rights Web materials on Amnesty and ported them
to a separate site. We should see if other existing AIUSA sites can contribute
materials. The development team should make an initial release for review
by CCWG/RG as a whole. We can place the AIUSA home page prototype on the
courtesy Peacenet for now, before a permanent site is chosen. However,
if possible, use the alias &lt;www.aiusa.org&gt; as the URL, so that the
address can remain constant when we change the physical site of the home
page </p>

<p>A3: The regional representatives of CCWG should work with their respective
regional offices to create the regional office home pages. The CCWG rep
should make sure that the regional office home pages are regularly updated.
(The actual task can be delegated to somebody else, but it seems natural
for the CCWG rep to take responsibility.) To achieve consistent appearance,
we should set up some kind of template for the regional pages. Hilary and
I have already discussed a set of similar logos for the pages. We have
recruited a Group 19 graphic artist to help creating these graphics. </p>

<p>A4: Start discussions with staff and volunteer member of AIUSA entities
that may have a stake in the Web development or electronic servicing. By
the end of the six-month period, we should have determined (1) whether
the entity has a need to be involved in Web development or electronic servicing,
(2) the resources and training that the AIUSA entity already has or needs,
(3) whether the AIUSA entity should be providing information to the AIUSA
home page, and if so, what are the possible mechanisms for the information
to be transmitted. I understand that Robin has already started discussing
WWW possibilities with staff members. </p>

<h4>Site Selection and Budgeting</h4>

<p>A6: Assemble a team of volunteers to investigate options for a permanent
site. Make a recommendation to the CCWG at the end of the investigation
period. </p>

<p>A7: Based on the recommended site, create a budget covering the start-up
cost and first-year maintenance cost. Request the fund from SIF. </p>

<h4>Service System and Coordination Among AIUSA Web pages</h4>

<p>A8: Use the mailing list of Amnesty (not just AIUSA) Web maintainers
to publicize the proposed AIUSA Web plan, and organize a servicing system
that all Web maintainers can accept. </p>

<p>A10: Recruit far and wide for volunteers to help servicing aiaction.
Place notices in MM, SAY, and all of the AIUSA conferences and mailing
lists. </p>

<p>A11: Request each Regional Director to create a plan for servicing on-line
inquiries. It may be as simple as finding one or more volunteer to service
the regional equivalent of &lt;aiaction@igc.apc.org&gt;. The on-line servicing
should be part of an integral plan to service inquiries arriving in the
forms of letters, phone calls, fax, and emails. </p>

<p>A12: Complete and make release 1.0 of the servicing FAQs. Make sure
that all front-line AI volunteers know about its existence and solicit
feedback from them. </p>

<h3>B. First Year</h3>

<p>B1: Based on the selected ISP and the results of A4 (extent of staff
involvement), create a second year budget to be approved by the Board.
</p>

<p>B2: Definitely place the AIUSA home page on the selected site. </p>

<p>B3: Complete and release version 2.0 of the Web pages. </p>

<p>B4: Based on the experiences of the first six months and the services
provided by the selected site, create a system for developing, reviewing,
updating, and uploading the pages on the AIUSA home page. The system should
include mechanisms for various AIUSA entities to participate in the maintenance
process. </p>

<p>B5: Create and release version 2.0 of FAQs. </p>

<p>B6: Create a set of style guides or templates for future WWW development.
</p>

<p>B7: Create a report examining the security and financial transaction
issues in on-line recruiting and information management. </p>

<p>B8. Develop a plan for Phase II and Phase III development. </p>
