Some thoughts on the use of computer communication in AIUSA
<p>
At the Western Regional Conference, in addition to the training workshop, we will have a Special Interest Group meeting to discuss some issues related to computer communication in AIUSA.  As part of the background material, I am writing up some of my thoughts on this area.  I'd like to submit these rough notes for comments.
<p>
I. Tools:
	
The Internet provides a variety of services for transmitting information across the network.  Some of the more common communication tools include: 
<p>
E-mail (for private exchange of messages and other things), 
mailing lists (for broadcasting messages to a list of subscribers) , 
telnet (for logging onto remote computers), 
newsgroups/conferences (for discussion groups, on-line news feeds, etc.), 
finger (for telling others about yourself and for looking up a particular person), 
FTP (for file transfer), 
gopher (for accessing menu-based information sources), 
IRC (internet relay chat: for interactive keyboard conversations with other Internet users ), 
WAIS (Wide-Area Information Server: for searching multiple on-line databases), 
WWW (World-Wide Web: for publishing and browsing Internet-wide multimedia hypertext).  
<p>
You can find detailed description of these services in a multitude of books.  A good guide is Electronic Frontier Foundation's Guide to the Internet, available free of charge from the EFF on-line archives at ftp.eff.org, gopher.eff.org, http://www.eff.org/, EFF BBS (+1 202 638 6120), American Online, and elsewhere.

II. Characteristics of Amnesty that have impact on CC
	
Amnesty is a volunteer-based world-wide organization. Unlike a corporation or university, its membership is fluid and its resources are limited.  Some comments on some factors that can affect how AIUSA volunteers use computer communication in their work:
<p>
A.	Geographic dispersion
<p>
- AIUSA volunteers and staff are spread all over United States.  In many ways, the Internet is a good match for the communication requirements of such a geographically dispersed organization.  Once the network is set up, communication between distant points is cheap, fast, reliable, and versatile. 
<p>
- However, unlike alternatives such postal mail and telephone, access to the Internet is not universal. Rural areas especially are not well served, and the cost tends to be higher.
<p>
B.	Staff/volunteer distinction
<p>
- Staff generally have access to Peacenet.  Supported by computer professionals within AIUSA. Their work practice can be changed by policy changes in the organization.  However, it appears that many are not comfortable using the net. 
<p>
- Uneven access to the net among volunteers. Some volunteers are computer professionals; others have technophobia.  As volunteers, their computer needs are not supported by hired computer professionals.  Training workshops in conferences provide limited help.  The organization has to accommodate the capability of volunteers. (In contrast, a university can require that its students should own a computer as part of the entrance requirements.)
<p>
C.	Internal/external distinction
<p>
- Amnesty distinguishes different levels of confidentiality: sensitive information that may harm individuals if not handled properly, internal strategic planning or preliminary discussions, requests for actions, directed outreach material, public information.
<p>
- Need to have access control.  Internet grew up as an open system.  Access control is difficult.  Amnesty does not have its own host on Internet.  It has control on some Peacenet  conferences, but access to Peacenet is limited. 
<p>
D.	Uneven resources among groups
<p>
- Amnesty groups vary widely in size, resources, and computer sophistication.  A large percentage of groups have no access to email. (Among 16 S.F. Bay area groups, 5 have no access in 1994. I believe the percentage is higher in other areas.)  Computer communication cannot easily replace postal distribution of information as long as large number of groups cannot be reached electronically. 
<p>
E.	Grassroots, small-group orientation
<p>
- Amnesty groups tend to be small, from a few individuals to a few dozen members.  The smaller the average size of groups, the more likely that a group has no access. (In contrast, Sierra Club chapters are huge. It is practically certain that you can find at least a computer expert among the active members of any given Sierra Club chapter.)
<p>
III.	Comparison of four Amnesty volunteer mailing lists
<p>
In the last year or two, several electronic mailing lists have emerged as tools for communicating among AIUSA volunteers or reaching to the public.  These four AIUSA mailing lists described below have very different purposes and membership composition. Together they provide interesting contrasts and illustrate the range of possibilities as well as limitations.
<p>
A.	amnestyd
<p>
- Membership: Amnestyd has more than 100 active AIUSA volunteers and staff members from all over the country (and some British colleagues).   Internal to Amnesty, it appears that the members are recruited mostly by word-of-mouth. Administered manually by a list maintainer.
<p>
- Function: Amnestyd is a great resource for having Amnesty-related questions answered.  It also serves as a medium of communication among staff, Board members, and volunteers.
<p>
- Criteria for success: a critical mass of knowledgeable Amnesty members who are willing to contribute to discussions.
<p>
B.	aiusagr19
<p>
- Membership: More than 50 people who are interested in receiving Group 19's monthly newsletter.  Some are active Group 19 members, but many are just curious about Amnesty.  The availability of the newsletter are announced on several Usenet newsgroups. Administered manually by a list maintainer.
<p>
- Function: aiusagr19 is primarily an outreach tool.  It is used to distribute Group 19 newsletters and to announce Group 19 activities.  It is not a communication tool among members of the list.  Hardly anyone except the mailing-list administrator post to the mailing list.
<p>
- Criteria for success: the quality of the newsletter has to be good enough to maintain the interest of the mailing list members, and the availability of the newsletter should be widely known (to attract new members).
<p>
C.	amnesty@list.stanford.edu
<p>
- Membership: Members of Stanford University Amnesty group.  Unlike a local group, here EVERY member of the group has an e-mail account. The list is administered through a LISTSERV-type program. 
<p>
- Function: This mailing list has not been very active. It has been used for announcing meeting and activities, for postings on human-rights-related job openings,  and for asking questions about campus activities.
<p>
- Criteria for success: Because every group member has university e-mail account, it was easy to set up the list. Potentially the list can be a great tool for communicating among group members.  However, the usage of the list has been light.  Perhaps on a small campus, frequent face-to-face and telephone contact make the list relatively superfluous.  Perhaps the range of activities of a campus group does not require frequent communication and coordination among group members.
<p>
D.	aiusancal
<p>
- Membership: Group members from San Francisco area Amnesty groups, members of the BAD committee, and the San Francisco office.  Members of mailing list was mostly recruited by telephone contacts.  Administered manually by a list maintainer.
<p>
- Function: As originally conceived, the list is supposed to be used to (1) share local information and resources, (2) announce local AI events or other events of interest, (3) respond to emergency action requests, (4) request for help in group activities, (5) coordinate regional events, media publicity, and legislative actions
<p>
- Criteria for success: Up to now, the list has been used mostly for announcements of events and some requests for help.  It has not emerged as a tool for coordination and mutual help among groups in the area.  For that to happen, I suspect that the groups have to have closer collaborative relationships, and list members have to be more comfortable using email as a coordination tool.
