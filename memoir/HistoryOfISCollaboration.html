1 October 2000

Dear Friends,

September 20, 2000 marked an important date in Amnesty's on-line
work. On this day, the public Amnesty document library, containing
news releases and country and thematic reports, switched from the
file-based system maintained by volunteers to a Domino-based system
administered by the staff of the Information Technology, Information
Resource, News Service, and Publication Programs of AI's International
Secretariat (IS). It is a transition worth noting and
celebrating. Finally, the IS website is integrated into the
Notes-based information system that the movement had adopted years
ago.

I'd like to take this occasion to recount the story of how, during the
past four years, staff and volunteers from 5 countries cooperated and
collaborated to maintain the IS website. It is a story made possible
by the advent of Internet and by the internationalism of the Amnesty
movement. Necessarily, the story is told from my perspective. I hope
others will correct my errors and omissions.

The IS website was launched in 1994 at the time of the Indonesian
Campaign. It was an attractive site containing a fair amount of useful
information. However, after a while, it was not getting updated and
was falling into disrepair. At the 1996 AIUSA Annual General Meeting,
Patti Whaley, AI's Deputy General Secretary, bemoaned, to Hilary
Naylor and me, the fact that the IS did not have enough resources to
maintain the website properly. Perhaps impressed by the big cowboy hat
I was wearing, she recruited me to work on the IS website.

In 1996 Devin Howse and Joanna Rollo from the Publication Program were
responsible for electronic publishing. They started to update the IS
website. At the same time, there were a lot of discussions on how
Weekly Mailing documents should be used to create an on-line document
library. In July 1996 Graham Lane, the directory of the Information
Technology Program, put me in touch with Pietro Antonioli of the
Italian Section, which had started to work on the problem of
converting Weekl Mailing documents from WordPerfect to HTML. In August
I started to adapt for the IS site some Unix shell scripts that
Gianluigi Fabrizi and Pietro Antonioli had created for the Italian
section website. Soon we had developed a system where Pietro and I
took turns using a collection of shell and perl scripts to convert
Weekly Mailing public news releases and reports into HTML, index them,
and automatically create various index pages. The Italian section
started to mirror the news and reports from the IS website instead of
developing their own library.

In November of 1996, the IS website moved to a server maintained by
Mike Blackstock, an AI-Canada volunteer. In 1997, we made various
improvements, including adding index pages for each country and
putting the full Annual Report on www.amnesty.org for the first time.

Devin Howse wrote on January 22, 1997, in response to a query from me:

Obviously, the question didn't get sorted out in March of 1997.

In September 1997, I was invited to visit University of Pavia in Italy
and had another workshop to attend in Stockholm. I arranged my trip so
that I could stop in London on the way to Italy and visited the IS for
the first time. Hilary was vacationing in UK at that time. Graham Lane
arranged a series of meetings between us and other IS staff to discuss
how we could advance AI's on-line work. I met Joanna Rollo, Devin
Howse, Graham Lane, Sarah Bennison, Chris Catton, and others who were
involved in distributing AI documents. For the first time I saw the
"Swedish Weekly Mailing Database."

During my trip to Italy, I met Pietro Antonioli and Silva Ferretti,
the AI-Italy web coordinator. Among other things, we talked about a
plan to include the processing of internal AI documents from Weekly
Mailings. At Stockholm AI office, I met Janne Odqvist, who showed me
how they were putting new releases and Weekly Mailing documents into
Notes databases. At that time, news releases on the IS website were
always late because they didn't get put on-line until they became
available to us in Weekly Mailings. Janne was uploading news
releases on the Swedish section website as soon as they were
released. I asked whether he could upload these news releases to the
IS website at the same time that he put them up on the Swedish
site. Perhaps not knowing that he would be chained to this task for
the next 2 3/4 years, he agreed.

After getting back to the US, I worked on scripts that could (1) read
an uploaded news release, (2) take out AI-Sweden formating code, (3)
add IS website formatting code, (4) put the new release in its proper
place, and (5) update various index pages automatically. By the
beginning of 1998, thanks to Janne, the IS website was getting timely
postings of AI news releases.

In 1998 we added processing of internal Weekly Mailing documents for
the Italian Amnesty website. Earlier in 1997, I quit my involvement
with AIUSA's web effort in frustration and started the
amnesty-volunteer.org project with Hilary and other friends. We
started to make internal Weekly Mailing documents available to AI
members at that site. Silva Ferretti from Italy and Geoff Wilkins from
UK added their design and programming expertise to improve the IS
website. We automated the posting of news releases to the amnesty-L
mailing lists through Janne's uploads. Thus Janne became the source of
AI news releases on-line distribution at the Swedish site,
www.amnesty.org, amnesty-L mailing list, and, through mirroring,
AI-Italy website. By this time it was clear from Swedish Section's
work that Domino web server is the right way to go for presenting AI
document library on the Internet.

In 1999 Devin Howse left IS and Brian Healy and Graham Francis took up
the responsibility for electronic publishing. We started to discuss
how to shift the document library to a Domino-based system.

In August of 1999, I attended another work-related workshop near
Stockholm and visited Janne again. By that time, he had been
single-handedly distributing elecctronic news releases for Amnesty for
more than a year and half. The IS had not taken over the maintenance
of the Weekly Mailing Notes database and there was no prospect of IS
posting news releases directly to www.amnesty.org. We were getting
frustrated with the the pace of work at the IS.

After I got back, I fired off some strongly-worded messages with the
aim of pushing for faster conversion to Notes and relief for Janne,
who was heroic in keeping the IS website up-to-date with news releases
day in and day out. To the credit of folks at IS, they took my
complaints (joined by Pietro and others) seriously and explained to us
that they had a plan about using Notes to originate news and reports,
that they had the infrastructure and the money to do it but they
didn't have a person available to carry out this work. Then Daniel
Eriksson came on board, and together with Mike Shamash, the new ePub
coordinator, Anthony Duncomb, and others at IS, made the Domino-based
AI news and reports library on the web a reality. On September 20,
2000, Pietro and I stopped our 4-year tour of duty doing Weekly
Mailing updates of the IS website, and Janne stopped his 2 3/4 year
work supplying news releases to the websites and amnesty-L mailing
list.

It amazed me that, in these four years, so many of us from such
differing backgrounds worked so well together. All of us were
dedicated to the goal of making Amnesty's web presence as good as
possible. We managed to collaborate effectively, each contributing in
his or her own ways. Graham Lane provided excellent leadership,
coordinating various IS programs with volunteers doing the
work. Joanna Rollo, Devin Howse, Brian Healy, Graham Francis, and Mike
Shamash, as IS ePub officers, had overall responsibility for the IS
website, yet they allowed volunteers to take charge of a substantial
part of the website (the document library). Chris Catton was always
ready to answer questions concerning AI documents. Dave Gregory at IS
designed the Weekly Mailing file format that we relied on. He, Ray
Mitchell at AI-UK, and Sven Bodin at AI-Sweden continuously encouraged
us. Mike Blackstock provided system support ad the Internet access
that we used. Hilary Naylor gave us her insights on on-line
activism. Patti Whaley and Sarah Bennison hovered over us with their
benevolent oversight. Silva Ferretti and Geoff Wilkins contributed
their design and programming talents. Janne Odqvist gets the gold
medal for absolute dedication and iron-man perseverance to get the
news releases out. Pietro was a reliable collaborator and a good
friend in getting the work done and in pushing the project
forward. IRP people put out Weekly Mailings reliably every week. I am
sure there are others who made the whole process possible.

I am extremely thankful that the folks at IS took my ideas and
suggestions seriously, even when my words were designed to galvanize
them into faster actions, and allowed me to work as an equal partner
in this staff-volunteer collaboration.  I know that such openness and
trust of volunteers can't be taken for granted. I am impressed with AI
Sweden staff's dedication to put AI resources on-line, and AI Italy's
willingness to coordinate their work with the IS and contribute their
effort toward the greater good.

Now that the IS website is using Domino server to present AI reports
and news releases, it is time that we visit
http://www.web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf and
http://www.web.amnesty.org/news.nsf, and celebrate the work that
people in IT, Publication, News, and IRP Programs are doing to put
news releases and documents into Notes databases and to present them
on the web. Praise the new team's work, update your links, and offer
suggestions to make the AI website the premier source of information
on the Internet regarding human rights issues.

Even though I no longer have to update the on-line AI document library
and I am no longer a member or supporter of AIUSA, I hope I can
continue to contribute to the Amnesty movement in some small ways.

With warm regards,
Samson Tu
