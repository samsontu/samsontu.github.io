Dear Friends,
<p>
Fortuitously, accountability and information technology have been very much 
on my mind recently. In this message, I'd like to explore the issue of 
accountability in relation to the amnesty-volunteer.org project.
<p>
Almost two years ago, some fellow AI volunteers and I started the 
"amnesty-volunteer.org" project whose goal was to build an online archive 
of shared AI resources for AI volunteers. You can read about this project at
<p>
http://www.amnesty-volunteer.org/aboutaivol.shtml
<p>
From the very beginning, we wanted to make this a collaborative effort 
among AI staff and volunteers from around the world. The bulk of the 
content on this site are member-only documents that we've collected from 
various sources. People from the IS, AI-New Zealand, AI-UK, AI-Italy, 
AI-Sweden, and AIUSA contributed these materials. At the same time, we host 
home pages for AI groups and structures from a number of sections. We 
developed mechanisms for "gatekeepers" who manage usernames and passwords 
for members of their sections, and mechanisms for hosted groups to upload 
their web pages to the site independently of site administrators.
<p>
Personally I see this work as an extension of the work I did on the IS 
website to build an online library of public AI documents. I had described 
the site and the mechanisms we developed to people in the Information 
Technology Program and Publication Program and to member of the ITGEN list.
<p>
However,  because this is a volunteer-initiated transnational project, our 
accountability to the established AI section structure has been called into 
question in some quarters. As AI explores the issues of virtual groups and 
other online structures, I suspect that problems of decision-making and 
accountability and of the relationship between transnational entities and 
regular sections will become recurrent issues. I think it is worthwhile to 
examine amnesty-volunteer.org as a case study.
<p>
Currently there are three classes of people in the amnesty-volunteer.org 
project who have decision-making authorities on content and access: (1) 
gatekeepers (2) developers of hosted home pages (3) site administrators and 
developers.
<p>
(1) The job of gatekeeprs is to verify AI membership of username/password 
applicants. By design, gatekeepers from each section has complete 
responsibility for managing users from their section. Thus, gatekeepers 
should be accountable to their sections. However, because users of 
amnesty-volunteer.org has access to materials contributed from several 
sections, there should be a consensus on a minimum standard. The IS can 
contribute toward such a consensus by establishing a movement-wide 
classification of document types and their users. Discussions in 
preparation of and resulted from the last Amsterdam CCWG meeting have been 
very useful.
<p>
A second problem concerning gatekeepers is their source of authority to 
manage users from their sections. Some sections had specifically appointed 
gatekeepers. Many were recruited informally. I see this as a weakness of 
amnesty-volunteer.org. If IS moves toward adopting something similar to the 
gatekeeper system, we need to formalize the relationship between sections 
and gatekeepers. I see this as common problem for Internet-based AI 
structures that also have a section component.
<p>
(2) AI structures that have home pages hosted on www.amnesty-volunteer.org.
These content providers of amnesty-volunteer.org generally have someone, 
not necessarily a site co-administrator, who can upload and modify their 
pages. I believe that these content providers should be accountable to 
whatever structures to which they are accountable originally. Thus,  the 
AI-Spain local group that has its home page on www.amnesty-volunteer.org 
should answer for their pages to AI-Spain. The amnesty-volunteer.org site 
administrators shouldn't be responsible for these pages.  This is another 
lesson I draw from this project: we need to make the persons responsible 
for different parts of the structure abundantly clear to those who may be 
concerned. Up to now we haven't systematically do this, and that is a mistake.
<p>
(3) Co-administrators the amnesty-volunteer.org project is a self-appointed 
group of volunteers. To whom should they be accountable?
<p>
Established sections are a poor vehicle for supervising this group. We deal 
with multiple AI sections and some of us may not be members of any section. 
In 1999, I formally quit AIUSA and I do not wish to be seen as an AIUSA 
member anymore.  (Pietro Antonioli said AI-Italy has made me one of their 
own, thus allowing me to handle "member-only" documents from Weekly 
Mailings. :-) In the future, we should expect more volunteers who wish to 
work for Amnesty purely in the virtual world, bypassing 
geographically-defined AI sections.
<p>
One possibility is that, in the absence of an Internet-based virtual 
section, IS takes responsibility for transnational AI structures such as 
amnesty-volunteer.org. I don't think we have formalized such a relationship 
for amnesty-volunteer.org. However, because (1) my working relationship 
with IS staff since 1996, (2) IS agreed to host amnesty-volunteer.org on 
the amnesty.oil.ca machine administered by Mike Blackstock, and (3) 
acceptance by CCWG and IS to use amnesty-volunteer.org to explore issues 
like "gatekeeper" system, I assume that the amnesty-volunteer.org project 
has the approval of the IS, We strive to maintain the site according to 
standards approved by the IS. For example, we adopted the restricted access 
policy for member-only Weekly Mailing documents that AI-Italy established 
with IS approval until we gained explicit permission to make them available 
to all members. I think, until there is a virtual section to which 
responsibilities can be delegated, the IS should be prepared to sponsor 
Internet-based AI structures that transcend national boundaries.
<p>
A second model of accountability that we explored briefly is to establish 
an "editorial board" similar to what many academic journals have. The idea 
is that an editorial board, consisting of staff and long-time volunteer 
leaders, can constitute a decision-making authority to which site 
administrators are responsible. The idea fizzled because we don't have a 
good mechanism for building such a board, and because we don't have the 
time and energy to carry out many suggestions made by the initial "board".
<p>
A third kind of accountability that is specific to amnesty-volunteer.org is 
our accountability to the sources of the AI resources we put on our site. 
Two examples are the "Casework Manual" and the "Fund for Freedom". Both are 
compendiums of ideas and techniques gathered from many AI sources and 
edited by AIUSA volunteers. We worked with editors of these sources and got 
their approval for the way we presented and distributed the materials.
<p>
Issues of decision-making and accountability are central to developing and 
maintaining good working relationship. Clarity on these issues helps to 
develop trust among participants of a project. On the other hand, consensus 
on these issues can only be based on trust and good working relationship. I 
am glad that these issues are being taken seriously by the international 
movement. I hope the experiences of the amnesty-volunteer.org project help 
us to think about these issues in the context of volunteer-initiated 
transnational AI structures that I expect will become even more prevalent 
in the future.
<p>
Best wishes,<p>
