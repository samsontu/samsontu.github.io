Experiences of AIUSANCAL -- Report on a Local-Area Amnesty Mailing List
<p>
By Samson Tu, AIUSA Group 19, Palo Alto, California <br>
May, 1995
<p>
Back in December of 1994, I announced on amnestyd mailing list the
formation of "aiusancal," a mailing list for northern California Amnesty
volunteers and staff.  At the time, I promised to write up our
experiences with the mailing list.  Here is the first (maybe only) installment of the promised write-up.  I hope the experiences summarized here
are useful to other Amnesty activists seeking to build an electronic
communication infrastructure for our organization. I'd also love to see
other Amnesty activists writing up their computer communication experiences
and share them with us.
<p>
The report is organized into the following sections:
<p>
1. Summary of findings<br>
2. Issues in organizing the mailing list<br>
3. Uses of the mailing list<br>
4. Thoughts about future directions <br>
5.Conclusions
<p>
1. Summary of findings
<p>
We found that in the Northern California, the home of Silicon Valley, use of
electronic mail to coordinate Amnesty events and group is still uneven and
limited. Organizing a mailing list with representation from most of the groups in the area was hard work. Usage and participation among members of the list was uneven. The experience suggests that, to be successful, a mailing list like aiusancal needs a core of individuals dedicated to its use.  
<p>
The predominant use for a local-area list at present time is announcement of local events.  It is somewhat useful for
soliciting help in organizing local-area events. 
<p>
By itself, however, a
mailing list cannot overcome AIUSA's predominant culture of local
independence.   The experiences with aiusancal also shows that a local-area
list can only be one component of an electronic network organized along
multiple dimensions.
<p>
2. Issues in organizing the mailing list
<p>
At present aiusancal has 25 members whose AI affiliations include 10 of the 16 local groups, Stanford University and UC Berkeley groups, Bay Area Development Committee, and the Western Regional Office. In the following, I will discuss issues in recruiting members for the list and in deciding on features of the list. I will also look at the participation rate of the members.
<p>
a. Recruitment
<p>
I have not documented the growth of its membership over time.  Table 1 shows
the number of messages posted to the mailing list each month since its
inception.  July 1994 to November 1994 was the recruitment phase, when I
called up the coordinators of each group in the San Francisco Bay area to
see if anyone in the group had Internet access. Membership in the mailing
list stabilized around that time.  The recruitment process was arduous.  My
emphasis was trying to get as many groups represented in the mailing list as
possible.  Even though the formation of this mailing list was announced in
the Bay Area Development (BAD) Committee's BADNews and at BAD committee
meetings, the primary organization tool was good old telephone calls. It was
not easy to find AI members with electronic mail access. Sometimes the
information list provided by the regional office was not up-to-date.
Sometimes the coordinators didn't know who had Internet access. Sometimes a
group wants to discuss the idea of the mailing list before joining.  (One
group decided not to join even though it had Internet access. :-(  )  I
mailed a postal letter to every group in Northern California not in the San
Francisco Bay area, inviting  them to join the mailing list without
receiving a single response.  
<p>
>From my experience organizing the aiusancal mailing list, I suspect that,
for most groups, the use of electronic communication in Amnesty work is
still a relatively new concept, and that we either have to provide intensive
training in the area, or we need to recruit more aggressively from the
electronic-aware part of the population.  (The Amnesty group located in the
heart of Silicon Valley, for example, has nobody with Internet connection.)
<p>
The second conclusion I draw from the recruiting experience is public
announcements still cannot compete with person-to-person contact. The
formation of the aiusancal list was announced at numerous places. Yet I
received few responses from such announcements.  I ended recruiting a
majority of the members through telephone calls.
<p>
A third conclusion is that it takes an unusually dedicated individual to
organize a mailing list like aiusancal.  I made dozens and dozens of phone
calls when I was trying to contact members of the 16 Amnesty local groups in
San Francisco Bay area. Instead of relying on such individual effort to
create an electronic infrastructure, AIUSA needs to commit its
organizational resources.  The ACs, SACs, and Cogroups should be convinced
of the value of such infrastructure, and made part of the organizing effort.
<p>
b. Features
<p>
A mailing list can be (1) maintained automatically (where a program
automatically add or delete subscribers) or manually, (2) moderated (where a
moderator controls what get posted to everyone on the list) or unmoderated,
and (3) set up to send responses to everyone or set up to send responses to
senders of messages. AIUSANCAL is manually maintained, unmoderated, and set
up so that replies go to message senders by default.  
<p>
The problem with automated list maintenance is that the technology at my
disposal does not allow me to check the new member's affiliation with AIUSA.
The same problem plague other internal Amnesty lists.  Fortunately, being a
local list, aiusancal is easy for me to maintain manually.  With such a
closed mailing list, it is unnecessary for me to moderate messages posted to
the list.  Finally, I  want messages sent to the list to be of interest to
members as a whole.  Sending replies to the original poster tends to keep
messages directed individuals out of the list. The downside of this
arrangement is that some reply messages that may be of interest to the whole
list sometimes get posted to individuals.  I don't know how serious this
problem is. (Comments?) When that occur to me, I simply reposted the message
to the whole list.
<p>
c. Volume and participation rate
<p>
For a mailing list to be successful, it must have content, high
signal-to-noise ratio, and high participation rate among its members.  I
will defer the analysis of content to the next section. 
<pre>
Table 1: Number of messages from July, 1994 to April 1995
July 	Aug	Sep	Oct	Nov	Dec	Jan	Feb	Mar	Apr
7	7	3	9	20	13	17	49	27	26
</pre>
<p>
The participation rate is high in terms of the number of people who have
posted to the mailing list.  Seventeen persons, out of the current 25, have
posted at least one message to the mailing list.  However, if measured in
terms of the number of messages, the participation rate is grossly uneven.
Most people are passive recipients.  As can be seen in Table 2, three
persons (out of 17 persons) accounted for 104 of the 126 messages posted to
the mailing list (83%).  The mean number of messages posted is a little over 5.
<p>
<pre>
Table 2: Number of persons responsible for the messages from July 1994 to
April 1995
# of messages	36	32	18	11	8	7	6	5	2	1
# of persons	2	1	1	1	1	1	1	2	2	5
</pre>
<p>
There are different ways of interpreting the numbers. One can legitimately
say that aiusancal is a failure because it has not elicited more balanced
and broader participation. While not happy with the lope-sided participation
rate, the conclusion I draw from the statistics is that, at present time,
for a mailing list like aiusancal to have significant content,  it must have
a core group of frequent contributors.  Experiences on other mailing lists
and conferences are consistent with this conclusion.  Every general-purpose
electronic forum I know of has a large number of lurkers.  The participation
rate, I believe, will improve when our community gains more maturity with
electronic communication and when local-area collaboration becomes more
common (as recommended by the SPiT and MAT teams).  I will further explore
these issues in the next section.
<p>
3. Uses of the mailing list
<p>
When I started to organized the mailing list, I hypothesized that the
mailing list will allow us to:
<p>
1. Announce local AI events (or other events of interest)<br>
2. Share local information and resources<br>
3. Respond to emergency action requests<br>
4. Request for help in group activities<br>
5. Coordinate local-area events, media publicity, and legislative actions
<p>
To test this hypothesis, I collected most of the messages posted on the
system and classified them according to each of the 5 categories.  Table 3
shows the number of messages in these categories.  (You should not take the
exact numbers to seriously. Many messages can be classified in more than one
ways.  My categorization is somewhat arbitrary.)
<p>
<pre>
Table 3 
A	B	C	D	E	F
111	37	15	15	12	11
</pre>
<p>
A: Announcements <br>
B. Sharing of information<br>
C. Response to emergency<br> 
D. Request/response for help in local group activities<br>
E. Coordination of local activities<br>
F. Others
<p>
By far the largest number of messages on aiusancal are announcements of
events, followed by sharing of information. Response to emergencies,
requests for and responses to requests for help, coordination of local
activities, and others are roughly equal in number.
<p>
Even though there are few messages related to emergency response, requests
for help, and coordination of local activities, looking at these messages
are instructive.  On one occasion when the mailing list was used to post
emergency media action requests, some list members complained about the
message overload.  Subsequently, the list was used to solicit medialist
members.  Similarly, when I was organizing a celebration of Ginetta's 50th
anniversary, I used the aiusancal mailing list to recruit interested
parties, but I established a separate mailing list for people participating
in the event. Thus, aiusancal has proved itself to be a tool to recruit
people for specific activities, but not a good place for follow-up messages,
which should only be sent to the relevant people. 
<p>
San Francisco area is unusual in that it has a regional office and a Bay
Area Development Committee.  However, in my judgment, aiusancal has not been
used extensively to inform people of their activities. In part, I suspect
that the computer communication has not been an integral part of their work,
and the results of using the mailing list has not justified the extra time
and effort.  (Comments?)
<p>
Comparing the usage of aiusancal with the national list amnestyd is
instructive.  I haven't had the chance to analyze the usage patterns of
amnestyd. (Any volunteers? I have all of the raw data.) My impression is
that amnestyd tends to be more issue-oriented and to have more requests for
help. Thus, different mailing lists, because of differences in their
geographic and organizational scope and in their membership, occupy
different niches in serving the information needs of AIUSA.
<p>
4. Thoughts on the future
<p>
Where do we go from here? Aiusancal is incomplete--6 or 7 local groups in
the Bay area not yet part of the mailing list.  Most of the groups have no
Internet access.  We need to step up recruitment on the Internet.  The
groups that have more access perhaps should think of ways of helping other
groups to recruit members, possibly by advertising for these groups on local
electronic forums. 
<p>
The experiences of aiusancal suggest that a local-area based Amnesty mailing
list is a useful part of Amnesty's communication infrastructure.  I can
envision such mailing lists or local bboards springing up elsewhere in the
U.S. I can also envision a future where such local electronic forums are
organized into a hierarchical network, forming the electronic component of
AIUSA's communication infrastructure.
<p>
5. Conclusions
<p>
The experiences of aiusancal, I believe, has helped us to gain a more
realistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of electronic
communication.  Mailing lists (and I believe the conclusions hold for other
computer communication tools such as conferences, gopher, and WWW) are cheap
and effective means to reach a targeted audience. From the numbers in Table
5, I conclude that a local-area mailing list is a good place for making
announcements and for sharing of information.  It is not a good place to
coordinate regional or emergency actions, although it is a source for
recruiting members of other more focused and issue-oriented mailing lists. 
<p>
Computer communication is not a magic wand that will create a community
where none existed before.  When there is no tradition of inter-group
communication and collaboration, the mere existence of a communication
channel will not change anything. Moreover, the use of electronic mail is
still new to many people, who are not used to write computer messages.
Typing these messages may be seen as extra work on top of existing
paper-based practices. Finally, for all of the conveniences that electronic
communication provides, it still cannot compete with face-to-face contacts
or telephone calls in developing personal relationships. Personal contacts,
such as the ones I have had with many AI activists, can motivate and inspire
in ways that electronic mail cannot. (So go to the AGM!)
