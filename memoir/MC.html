HN and RM's comments pushed one of my buttons.

<p>
On multiculturalism (MC)

<p>
RM> that some don't consider a priority probably has something to do
RM> with viewing the effort as singing to the choir.
HN> It is not singing to the choir, because AIUSA suffers from institutional
HN> racism just as much as any other american organization or corporation.

<p>
I'd attribute in part the low priority given to multiculturalism to
the way the survey question was asked. MC was listed as one of the
several items (such as case work and campaign work) COMPETING for
priority. Members join AI to do human right work. When asked which is
more important, case work or MC work, it is not surprising that most
people would choose case work. If the question is framed differently
(e.g., "If there are minority communities near your group, do you
consider it a high priority to recruit members from these
communities?"), I suspect you'll get somewhat different answers.

<p>
I am still trying to think through the issues of MC as applied to
AIUSA.  Far from a given, I don't think there is consense on the
meaning of MC.  Earlier this year I contacted CDRG to ask them for
materials on MC in AIUSA.  They pointed me to the Communitas Report.
Recently I had the chance to borrowed the report to see what AIUSA
means when it talks about MC. I was appalled by the training workshop
material. I feel the MC preached in it was an ideology in the worst
sense of the word. Its tone reminded me of bad communist propaganda. I
was glad that at least some people who went through the training
workshops felt the same way.

<p>
I suspect that we need to distinguish between MC as applied to the
AIUSA organization (staff and maybe volunteer leadership) and MC as
applied to individual groups. The power relations are very different
in the two categories.  Perhaps this is another reason for the
divergent views between local groups and the top-echelon of AIUSA on
this issue.

<p>
HN>    That's true, there has not been enough effort put into explaining to
HN> groups how being culturally diverse will help their work on their action
HN> file.  

<p>
Yes, somebody please explain to me how cultural diversity helps our
work on actions files. I assume it is more than language capability
and contacts with ethnic organizations. Can Rena cite chapters and
verses from her Bible?

<p>
For all of the importance placed on MC, I didn't see a workshop on the
subject in last year's AGM. I wonder if this year is going to be
different.

<p>
The part of the cultural diversity issue that I understand has to do
with membership. In California, soon the non-White population will
form a majority. If AI doesn't try to recruit them, AI will limit its
membership pool.

<p>
RM> There's probably a need for groups to be more assertive in
RM> recruiting from minority communities and making such individuals
RM> feel welcome.
RM>
HN>     That is where training and education are needed.

<p>
If AI is serious about cultural diversity, it has to devote resources
to it and devise strategies that are tailored to the circumstances of
the targeted communities and geographical areas.  One of the ideas
that I never got around to carry out in the past year, when I was the
Group 19 coordinator, was to do outreach to the South Bay Vietnamese
and Taiwanese communities. One reason was that I came to see outreach
to these communities as a regional issue, not something an individual
or a local group can do well. These ethnic communities are spread out
in areas served by at least 4 local groups.  Outreach to these
communities should be a coordinated effort of these groups.

<p>
(A couple comments on inter-group relationship: One of the things
about AIUSA that surprised me was the minimal interaction that
neighboring groups have with each other.  One aspect of inter-group
relationship I haven't heard people discussed is the potential
competition for members.  In metropolitan areas where several local
groups exist, volunteers can shop around for groups to join.  For
example, four of Group 19's core members live in Santa Clara.
Geographically they are closer to at least two other local groups. At
leat two of the four had attended other groups' meetings. Yet they
decided to work with Group 19 because it is more active and more fun.
Thus, successful groups can attract members at the expense of weaker
groups. If all four of Group 19's core Santa Clara members joined
another group, they can easily transform the character of that group.
Does anyone see similar phenomena in other areas?)
