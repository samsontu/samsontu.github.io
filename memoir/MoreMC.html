Dear Sarah,
<p>
I am sorry that I missed your diversity workshop at the Regional Conference. I was assisting with the Computer Communication Workshop at the same time.  As you know, I have some interest in the diversity issue in AIUSA. Unfortunately, like a lot of people, I am overcommitted, and won't have the time and energy to pursue it further. Last year, after attending the AGM in Chicago, I wrote down some ideas and questions on multiculturalism.  Just in case these notes may be useful to you, I am sending you this message. As a relative novice in AIUSA (this is only my 4th year of active participation in a local group), I have no idea how valid these ideas are. 
<p>
First, a confession: at the beginning of the year (1994), when our outgoing group coordinator asked me to give my ranking of important issues on the annual group survey, I placed multiculturalism last. That somebody like me, whose success in the U.S. critically depends on the tolerance and acceptance of multiculturalism by the American society, should place multiculturalim last should be troubling (at least to me).  Similarly, that an issue given high priority by the Board is ranked last by the membership should be troubling.  The following remarks are my effort to make sense of these discordant observations.
<p>
I understand multiculturalism to mean the principle that (1) the environment of an organization should encourage and promote the equal resepect for the cultural heritage of people with diverse ethnic backgrounds, and that (2) the composition of an organization should be reflective of demographics of the the general population of which it is apart.  It is not clear that we can consider AIUSA to be a homogeneous organization where the principle mean the same thing. We can at least distinguish three perspectives: staff, volunteer leadership (cogroups, ACs, SACs, etc), and volunteer members. The working environment and the process of recruitment and training are probably quite different for each group.  My experience only allows me to speak from the perspective of a volunteer member.
<p>
At the risk of being accused of making false distinctions, I'd like to propose that we distinguish between promoting multiculturalism because it is an intrinsic value that we want to uphold and because it is an effective mean for accomplishing other goals that we have.  As an intrinsic value, multiculturalism becomes a goal toward whose attainment we devote resources, possibly taking resources away from other goals that we may have. As an instrument for accomplishing other goals, the priority of multiculturalism depends on its utility in increasing our effectiveness.
<p>
What evidence do we have that multiculturalism is seen as an intrinsic value of AIUSA?  It is not clear to me where AIUSA leadership stand on this. The results of the group survey, however, clearly indicates that members join AIUSA to do human-rights work, not to promote multiculturalism.  Given a choice of doing case or campaign work and promoting multiculturalim (as the survey requires us to do), members chose human-right work.   
<p>
If AIUSA leadership want to make multiculturalism, like human rights, an intrinsic value of the AIUSA, it should be willing to devote substantial resources to promote it among membership.  Working around the periphery, making the Board more diverse, will not change the orientation of the membership.  To touch the membership in concrete way, the organization should be willing to launch a campaign, similar to country or theme campaigns, to promote diversity.  Given the low-ranking members give to MC, I suspect that such campaign will be difficult to sell.
<p>
What evidence do we have that multiculturalism increases the effectiveness of our work? I think we can analyze the question from four angles: (1) how diversity affects the methods and techniques of our human rights work (2) how diversity affects our policy decisions, (3) has lack of respect/understanding of multiculturalism driven potential minorities away, and (4) if AIUSA's membership reflects the cultural diversity of America as a whole, would our membership and group growth be different from what it is?.  
<p>
I don't have sufficient experience in AIUSA to comment on any of these perspectives in a generalized way. I would like those with more knowledge and wisdom to comment on these issues.  The only thing I will say is that when I look back on my involvment in my local group (as a member, as an action-file coordinator, and as the group coordinator), I don't see how my Asian face, my knowledge of Asian history and culture, and my experiences as a hyphenated American materially helped or hindered my work in the group.  It is true that my background helps to shape my perspective on issues such as WOOC guidelines and multiculturalism, but the impact of such opinions is at best long term, and not reflected in the day-to-day work on cases, campaigns, and group development. In contrast, my professional background has much more directly impact on the way I work within Amnesty.  Thus, it is not clear to me how cultural diversity can have much impact on the methods and techniques of Amnesty's work.
