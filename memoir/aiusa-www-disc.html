<p><b>Preface</b></p>

<p>During the latter part of 1995, members of AIUSA's Computer Communication
Working Group and Resource Group discussed extensively the issues involved
in developing an official AIUSA WWW home page. The following is my personal
synthesis of the discussions. Numerous people participated in the discussion,
and I can't identify their separate contributions. Thus, any credit for
the ideas raised here should go to CCWG and CCRG collectively. I'll be
happy to accept responsibility for the faults you may find here.</p>

<p>The initial goals of an AIUSA Web site include informing and educating
the public, generating actions, recruiting volunteers, and coordinating
AIUSA Web sites. A plan for accomplishing the goals should take into a
account a number of issues ranging from the content of the Web pages, the
logistic of distributed development, the ISP to use, the servicing needs
that will arise out of AIUSA's greater Internet presence.</p>

<h3>A. <a  NAME="contentappearance">Content and appearance </a></h3>

<h4>Content </h4>

<p>CCWG/RG members had suggested a number of possible items in the AIUSA
home page: </p>

<ul>
<li>General AIUSA information: Much of the general Amnesty (AIUSA) information
that appear in some home pages (eg, Georgia Tech and HR Web) probably should
become part of AIUSA site. </li>

<li>Press releases (timeliness is essential) </li>

<li>Campaign information: It would also be a good thing if materials for
AIUSA campaigns was put on the net officially by AI, and that there would
be official contact information </li>

<li>Special projects: e.g, Ginetta Sagan Fund </li>

<li>Coordination: A page devoted to linking and organizing all of home
pages created by AIUSA members </li>

<li>Recruitment: Pages listing local/student groups, organized by region
and state Pointers to contact information What would be even better is
if people could fill in a form, and be contacted by a representative of
the local/student group closest to where they are </li>

<li>Country information: Something else that would be good to have, but
that doesn't necessarily have to be done at an AI or an AIUSA level, is
a country-based source of information: a world map as an image map, and
you can click in each country and go to a page for that country. Each page
would contain information about the human rights situation in that country,
and links to other sources of human rights information about that country
in the net 
<br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>How can we decide what content to have? We propose a number of rules
that can help us to determine the content of the AIUSA home page. </p>

<ul>
<li>The content must be relevant to the goals that we establish for the
Web pages </li>

<li>The content should have been reviewed and approved by relevant members
or staff (e.g., UA pages reviewed by Scott Harrison, etc.). Alternatively,
the content should be developed by the relevant members or staff themselves,
possibly with help of others. </li>

<li>The content should not duplicate the work already done elsewhere (e.g.,
at IS level). the AIUSA web site should hold the &quot;official&quot; AIUSA
external documents (e.g., press releases, Op Ed pieces by the Executive
Director or Chair of the Board). Documents originating from the IS should
be the responsibility of the international organization. Documents describing
local activities are best left to the local (including student) groups.
</li>

<li>The content must be maintainable (nothing worse than out of date information)
</li>

<li>The AIUSA WWW page can contain pointers to non-Amnesty sites, but the
distinction in the nature of the sources of the document should be made
clear on the AIUSA web site. 
<br>The thing we should worry about is getting people to do more than just
browse. It's like the commercials for Amnesty on TV. The commercials give
people an easy way to respond with the 1-800 number and an easy to remember
address. The Web site should allow people to do a lot more, like buying
stuff, write letters, join mailing lists, register as a member, ask questions,
and find answers. 
<br>In addition to the criteria for inclusion enumerated above, we should
establish a <i>process</i> for proposing new content, developing the page,
reviewing the results, and maintaining the page. See the &quot;logistics&quot;
section for more discussion. </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Appearance </h4>

<p>To be effective, the AIUSA web site should be attractive visually. Our
web pages must have style, a consistent look and feel, a logical and coherent
organization, user-friendly for the low tech as well as the high tech visitor.
Graphics are currently the major draw to sites on the web, thus are important
for gaining attention to the site. If you look at all the &quot;cool sites&quot;
(as determined by commercial organizations), the most common feature standing
out is an intensive graphics presentation. After all, this is the same
gimmick that was partly responsible for the web craze this past year (along
with CGI). </p>

<p>
<br>The desire to have attractive graphics should be balanced by the fact
that many people have low network bandwidth. The pages should have good
*design* that is equally attractive with or without graphics. </p>

<p>
<br>Graphics and CGI programming are not a mystical art though. Many people
are really amazed and &quot;hooked&quot; by interesting graphics and animation,
but in reality they are just window dressing. Anybody can create very high
quality artwork given the right software (such as Adobe Photoshop) and
some time. </p>

<p>
<br>Ways to develop a consistent look-and-feel for a site include </p>

<ul>
<li>Develop templates for similar materials </li>

<li>Develop a style sheet for the pages </li>

<li>Create a repository of page components (e.g., AI candle logos) that
can be shared among different pages 
<br>A graphic designer potentially be included in the process. The role
of graphic designer needs to be clarified in the process. I propose we
recognize the distinction between a <i>graphic artist</i> and a <i>graphic
designer</i>. A graphic artist is someone who creates a particular piece
of art work (e.g., a logo or an illustration). A graphic designer, on the
other hand, is concerned about the visual impact of the overall design
(e.g., use color, choice of fonts, layout of the page, etc.). An analogy
may be the distinction between a cabinet maker and an interior decorator.
It is arguable that with right tools, a moderately talented lay person
can create interesting design elements, thus may not be necessary to engage
the service of graphic artists, but having a graphic designer reviewing
(or even participating in) the construction of the AIUSA web pages can
only enhance the quality of the final product. </li>
</ul>

<h3>B. <a  NAME="logistics">Logistics of development and maintenance </a></h3>

<p>Staff and volunteers must work together to develop and maintain the
web site. How can we work out the logistics of coordinating the development
and maintenance activities? We can look at the logistics from a number
of angles. Among others, the issues we can examine include where development
take place and where final products are stored, the division of responsibilities
between volunteers and staff, the division of responsibilities between
central administrators and off-site AIUSA entities, and tools that we may
use to facilitate cooperative development. The combinations and permutations
of possibilities are endless. In this section we will only discuss some
the principles that can guide the organization of the development and maintenance
effort. </p>

<ul>
<li>Leveraging existing resources: Numerous volunteer sites and one AIUSA
site for publications already exists. The effort to create the official
AIUSA site should build from the experiences and the materials that already
exist. </li>

<li>Maintaining continuity: Developing and maintaining the AIUSA web pages
is a long-term project. We need to assure that funding and personnel are
available to keep the project going. Some may see this requirement as an
argument for having staff as the primary site management person. However,
in my limited experience, it seems that the turn-over rate among the staff,
especially at the more junior level, is at least as high as that of volunteers.
I think what is important is the development of a team of people who can
manage the site individually and collectively, and providing for continuing
transfer of expertise and experiences to new members of the team. </li>

<li>Providing regular updates: For people to come back to the site again
and again, we need to continue to put up new materials and update old materials.
The problem is not having new materials to put up, the main difficulty
is to develop a system for the new materials to go up on the net on a regular
basis. One suggestion is that we make the process of freshening the home
page driven by the calendar, whereas otherwise it would be quite susceptible
to procrastination. For example, we can port a story from each issue of
Amnesty Action (probably the front-page story) and put it on the home page.
There would be a couple of paragraphs plus some photos/art, then a link
to the rest of the story elsewhere. Appropriate links could be attached
to selected phrases in the text. This method leverages existing product,
instead of adding a burden of conceiving and developing headline material
just for the Web. </li>

<li>Providing timely information: Some information, such as press releases
and urgent requests for actions, must be distributed in a timely manner;
otherwise much of their effectiveness may be lost. This requirement suggests
that we need some automated mechanism for translating such information
(possibly coming as e-mail messages) to web pages quickly and in an attractive
manner. It would also be desirable to have members of the web team creating
and linking web pages on short notice. Very likely that there will be a
trade-off between speed and automation on the one hand and attractiveness
on the other. It would be OK to have a link labeled &quot;Most Recent News&quot;
pointing to a simple FTP directory offering plain-text documents. </li>

<li>Defining and distributing responsibilities for (1) developing content,
(2) updating content, (3) reviewing content, and (4) installing content
on the server. It should be recognized that the AIUA web content will be
coming from different AIUSA entities and most likely distributed over multiple
Internet sites (e.g., the Publishing Department, for whatever reason, had
already picked Pluggin as their ISP). Some of the AIUSA entities will have
more web experiences and skills than others. Thus, whatever system we set
up should allow for as much independence as possible, while maintaining
a consistent overall framework, and giving special assistance wherever
it is needed. </li>
</ul>

<h3>C. <a  NAME="coordination">Coordination of AIUSA Web Pages </a></h3>

<p>Members of CCWG/RG have proposed a number of ideas for coordinating
the growing number of Web pages put up by members of AIUSA. Some of them
are listed below: </p>

<ul>
<li>We should have a mailing list of AIUSA Web developers (and probably
administrators of mailing lists, BBS, etc) </li>

<li>there should be a list of do/don't suggestions (or &quot;Tips 'n Traps&quot;,
or whatever). </li>

<li>Some resources (sample pages or templates, graphics, etc) would really
add value </li>

<li>CCWG should act as facilitator in expanding AI's electronic presence
(by giving workshops, providing resources, etc) </li>

<li>We should provide assistance, earlier on amnestyd, once you put up
an Amnesty Web page, you may get all sorts of questions from the public
We should have (1) a set of FAQs that help people to service the questions
(2) a system of referrals that let them hand off questions that they can't
answer themselves </li>

<li>We should provide information/education. For example, we should give
AIUSA members who are active on the net timely update on whatever policy
AI has on electronic publishing </li>

<li>We should provide a channel for AIUA members involved in electronic
actions to air their views and grievances, and bring them to the attention
of the proper staff, Board members, or IS-level CCWG. </li>

<li>We should do some kind of informal quality control. Most people are
not going to distinguish between &quot;official&quot; AI sites and &quot;unofficial&quot;
sites. 99.9 percent of what we see on the net are good effort. In rare
instances, though, something inappropriate may appear. </li>
</ul>

<h3>D. <a  NAME="choice">Choice of Service Providers </a>
<br></h3>

<p>This document tries to address the issues that have to be considered
in choosing a web site, but does not recommend a particular site. Choosing
such a site should be a task separate from preparing this document. </p>

<p>
<br>The argument about free site vs commerical vs non-profit is really
tied to what kind of site we are talking about. For a site that is limited
to 5-10MB of web pages and nothing else, free space on a commercial provider
might work. The uncertainty arises because the consequences of being at
a free site are no service and no support -- or at the best, service and
support which can't be counted on and expected. This means more work for
AIUSA. </p>

<p>
<br>In a sense, the choice of the Internet service provider is not a crucial
question. Through the use of the &lt;www.aiusa.org&gt; alias, we can maintain
a fixed address for the web site even if we have to change Internet service
providers. It is important to choose a good site initially, but the choice
is not fixed in stone. </p>

<p>
<br>In the two following subsections, we first enumerate the attributes
that an ideal ISP should have, then we make an attempt to evaluate some
of the existing candidates. </p>

<h4>Requirements 
<br></h4>

<p>Given the goals enumerated above, what attributes does an ideal AIUSA
web site provider have? (Here is the start of a list. I am running out
of time. Please contribute more as you see fit.) </p>

<ul>
<li>Adequate disk space </li>

<li>Enough network capacity and CPU horsepower for the servers </li>

<li>Reliable service (little or no down time), backup servers </li>

<li>Security mechanisms, including the possibility of compartmentalizing
the site so that different AIUSA entities can safely update their portions
of the pages without centralized intervention or interfering with pages
under other entities' control </li>

<li>Useful softwares (e.g., programs to automate uploading of press releases
from email to WWW space) </li>

<li>Mechanisms for financial transactions </li>

<li>Good technical support (technically competent AND fast response) </li>

<li>Good development environment (e.g., tools and test server for cgi script
development) </li>

<li>Technologically forward looking (alert to new development, bring in
new technology as appropriate) </li>

<li>Low cost </li>
</ul>

<h4>Options </h4>

<h4>Peacenet: 
<br>pros: </h4>

<ul>
<li>IGC is philosophically committed to our mission </li>

<li>Possible to get discount from IGC </li>

<li>They will go the extra mile to create a site for us that deserves to
called &quot;Cool&quot;! </li>

<li>They have provided a courtesy site free of charge </li>
</ul>

<p><b>cons: 
<br></b>1. List price is higher than other ISP </p>

<ul>
<li>Not clear how good their support is </li>

<li>Some of the services they provide (e.g., majordomo mailing lists) is
limited </li>
</ul>

<p>. 
<br><b>Pluggedin:</b> </p>

<p>
<br>pros: The Publication Department has already engaged their service.
The agreement on the home page there is not limited to that department.</p>

<p>
<br>cons: The disk space is limited and service is unreliable </p>

<p>
<br></p>

<p><b>A for-profit Internet provider</b> </p>

<p>
<br>pros: You get what you pay for. Possibly higher level of service if
we choose the provider carefully </p>

<p>
<br>cons: cost </p>

<p>
<br></p>

<p><b>A site willing to host our page pro bono</b> </p>

<p>
<br>pros: Free </p>

<p>
<br>cons: Possible lower level of service (in terms of technical support,
down time, and implementing advanced features that may be required) </p>

<p>
<br><b>Our own Internet host</b> </p>

<p>
<br>pros: Can control all of the functionalities that we want </p>

<p>
<br>cons: </p>

<ul>
<li>cost of leased line </li>

<li>cost of maintenance, especially personnel time </li>
</ul>

<h3>E. <a  NAME="servicing">Servicing</a> 
<br></h3>

<p>Web site development has to go hand-in-hand with a system for developing
online service capability. It's the experience of the current volunteer
Web sites that visibility on the net inevitably leads to inquiries that
need to be handled on individual basis. </p>

<p>
<br>Of course it would be best if the online information provided on the
Web pages and other automated response systems (e.g., auto-response software
that allows directory searching, sends files upon requests, and possibly
route messages with certain keywords to particular individuals) can answer
most of the questions that may arise. However, no matter how hard and how
well we put information on the net, we can expect that increasing visibility
will lead to increasing service requirement. </p>

<p>
<br>Currently, AIUSA's on-line servicing capability is still fairly weak.
A few volunteers service the aiaction@igc.apc.org address. The LA, Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast Regional Offices are willing and able to answer email requests.
(Their addresses are: aiusala@igcapcorg aiusamaro@igcapcorg and aiusanero@igcapcorg.)
The other offices are not ready yet. On the other hand, not all inquiries
need to be handled electronically. For example, until a secure system for
accepting payment electronically is set up, signing up national members
still require the use of telephones and postal mail. Similarly, if somebody
has the appropriate information in printed form, the e-mail response can
be just a request for postal address. </p>

<p>
<br>What kind of servicing system should we develop along side the WWW
site?</p>

<p>
<br>First, we must develop an <i>institutionalized</i> system. In other
words, servicing must be carried out by AIUSA as an organization, in a
way that assures continuity. It should not be a situation in which an office's
response mechanism fails because one person is away. </p>

<p>
<br>Second, the servicing should be <i>systematic</i>, in the sense that
all of the AIUSA entities that service inquires should be aware of the
roles they play and be aware of the capabilities and limitations of each
servicing entities. Each AIUSA volunteer or staff member who receive inquiries
from the net should know where to redirect the questions if they can't
handle the inquiries themselves. A good principle is to minimize the length
of the hand-off chain. Certainly the regional offices can and should play
a large role in the servicing system. They receive inquiries (most on phones
currently) all the time, and are the one part of the organization currently
tasked with finding answers to general inquiries. . Most of the requests
we receive for country information can be handled by an office volunteer
who pulls information from our files of all IS information. More difficult
queries can be passed on to co-group members or government program officers
in the DC office. For inquiries that cannot be handled by other AIUSA entities,
there seems to be a consensus that it is a good idea to have a central
email address (such as aiacation) to which the queries can be directed.</p>

<p>
<br>For the front-line Web developers who receive inquiries on the net,
we can provide guidelines on how to structure their WWW pages to facilitate
appropriate routing of questions. Thus, for example, a sensible structure
for a WWW page might be: </p>

<p>Click *here* if you wish to request more information about AI student
groups in metropolitan Chicago. </p>

<p>For information on other aspects of AI's work on behalf of human rights,
please check out the other links on this page If you've done so and cannot
find what you're looking for, click *here*. 
<br>Having good information resources, such as the FAQs under development,
available to the front-line people is another way to assure that inquiries
from the net are efficiently answered. </p>
