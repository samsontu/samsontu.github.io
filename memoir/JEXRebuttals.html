Re: JXE's resignation letter

Dear Sir:

HXN forwarded to me JXE's resignation letter, in which
he made some comments about me and about the amnesty-volunteer.org project.
These comments reflect misunderstandings that I'd like try to clear up.
Please allow me to make the following points:

1. I am not a member of AIUSA's CCWG. I resigned from that position in
1996. I trust that JXE is aware of that.

2. I am not a member of AIUSA. I stopped paying membership due in 1998, and
the due-waiver request that I made in 1998 should have expired in 1999. Up
to now I have not publicized this fact. However, to avoid future
misunderstanding, I will make an effort to let AIUSA staff and members know
that I am no longer an AIUSA member, and, although I still perform some
group-related tasks for AIUSA Group 19, I am not doing any work for AIUSA
and do not want to be seen as a member of AIUSA.

3. I am still an Amnesty volunteer. I help to update the IS website, and
I continue to collaborate with other Amnesty staff and volunteers on
internationally-oriented Amnesty work, including the amnesty-volunteer.org
project.

4. JXE said that 'though amnesty-volunteer.org is administered by AIUSA
members, they have portrayed this project as being outside of the
jurisdiction of AIUSA because of its "international" nature'. It is
understandable that JXE didn't know I am no longer a member of AIUSA.
Furthermore, he probably did not know that the amnesty-volunteer.org web
site is hosted on an IS computer, with an AI-Canada volunteer providing
system-administration support. He didn't know that amnesty-volunteer.org
hosts AI groups and structures from USA, Spain, Switzerland, Australian,
and United Kingdom, and THAT MOST OF THESE GROUPS UPLOAD THEIR WEB PAGES
INDEPENDENTLY, without my interventions. He didn't know that volunteers
from AIUSA, AI-UK and AI-Italy collaborated to develop the software used to
run the amnesty-volunteer.org site. If he had visited our site, he should
know that the IS, AI-UK, AI-Italy, AI-Sweden, AI-New Zealand, and AIUSA
volunteers contributed resources to the amnesty-volunteer.org site.
(Recently the AIUSA National Field Office contributed some materials, but
we have not had the chance to install those materials at the website yet.)
Members from as many as 20 AI sections and the IS are registered users of
the amnesty-volunter.org. I wish JXE had got his facts straight before
making his assertions. I don't think it is wise for AIUSA to claim
jurisdiction over an international site like amnesty-volunteer.org.

5. JXE said that we made ourselves "gatekeepers" and brokers for
information. The "gatekeepers" system is a unique feature of the
amnesty-volunteer.org designed to allow de-centralized management of users
and password WITHOUT much intervention from the site administrators.
Fifteen AI sections participate in the "gatekeeper" system. I described the
system at the 1998 international CCWG meeting, and was asked to implement
it and report our experiences to the international AI community. I did that
prior to the 1999 international CCWG meeting, and adoption of the
"gatekeeper" system by the IS was one of the recommendations of that
meeting. I am proud of the role that amnesty-volunteer.org played in
developing the "gatekeeper" system for the international AI community.

6. JXE said that I encouraged staff and members to contribute resources to
amnesty-volunter.org *instead* of the AIUSA website. I wish he had provided
evidence for that assertion. Yes, I solicited resources for the
amnesty-volunteer.org site FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHARING AMONG AI MEMBERS
AROUND THE WORLD. Amnesty-volunteer.org is not competing with any national
AI website. Contributors are free to send their materials to any other AI
structure. In fact, in the statement announcing the launch of the
amnesty-volunteer.org site, we explicitly said that, if a section website
has sufficiently secure internal area and if it will reciprocally share
resources with amnesty-volunter.org, we are happy to donate any and all
resources we've collected to that section. That's exactly the arrangement
we have with AI-Italy. We send them all amnesty-volunteer.org resources
they ask for. Thus, AI-Italy members have access to internal
amnesty-volunteer.org materials through their own website, and we are
relieved of the burden of managing AI-Italy users.

7. JXE said that, by positioning myself outside AIUSA, I am not
accountable for my actions. Since 1996, I've worked closely with the IT and
Publication Programs at the IS. The amnesty-volunteer.org site is hosted on
an IS computer. The goal of the site is to create a mechanism for AI staff
and volunteers from around the world to share AI resources. For these
reasons, I have always thought that my work on the amnesty-volunteer.org
project should be accountable to the international AI community, and to the
IS in particular.

The issue of accountability is more complicated than deciding to whom
Samson Tu should be accountable. Much of the materials at
amnesty-volunteer.org is meant for sharing among the international AI
community. On the other hand, we also host AI groups and structures that
belong to specific sections. We need to develop a system that allows
sections to monitor those parts of the amnesty-volunteer.org that relate
them and develop channels for resolving problems, given that many of the AI
groups and structures hosted at amnesty-volunteer.org manage their own
areas without intervention or even knowledge of site administrators. Had
JXE been willing, we could have a constructive dialog on these issues.

Both JXE and I have left AIUSA. I don't see any need for specific
actions regarding my relationship to AIUSA. I hope this memo clarified some
of the issues raised in JXE's letter.

JXE's letter was addressed to "K, CXG, and Bill." I do not know
K. I trust this memo will be forwarded to her.

Best regards,
Samson Tu
