Re: JEX's harassment charge

Dear Sir:

HNX told me that she will be attending a mediation meeting to
resolve the harassment charge arising from JEX's
resignation. I was a bit surprised, because I didn't remember
harassment was an issue JEX raised. Upon re-reading JEX's
resignation letter, I saw that indeed he said that was was resigning
in part because of "the relentless harassment from a couple of
members."

I had missed this part of his letter because I didn't see any
description of harassment action in the rest of the letter. He alleged
that CCWG members didn't give him any support, that "HNX and
friends continued to build their database of Amnesty members and staff
and position themselves as gatekeepers and brokers for information,"
that "HNX and Samson Tu have systematically encouraged staff and
members to send materials to the amnesty-volunteer.org site instead of
the AIUSA site," and that we were unaccountable for our words and
actions. Even if all of these allegations were true, and I had
rebutted them in my previous memo to you (enclosed below), I fail to
see how these allegations add up to "relentless harassment." How does
the fact that some of us work on the amnesty-volunteer.org site, a
site that is well respected in the international Amnesty community,
constitutes harassment of an AIUSA staff member?

During JEX's entire tenure at AIUSA, I met him once and had
less than 10 email exchanges with him. Let me recount these
interactions I had with him:

1. Because HNX and I previously helped to manage the AIUSA website,
  when JEX first started at AIUSA, he contacted me to get
  information about the AIUSA website. 

2. At one time I checked broken links on the AIUSA website using the
  software that the IS bought for me, and gave him the information so
  that he could fix those bad link.

3. At one time I complimented the improvements he made on the AIUSA
  website. (I do think highly of his work on the AIUSA website.)

4. In early 1999 (I believe it was March), I was in New York City for
  a relative's wedding. I took the opportunity to visit JEX
  . My goal was to gain his support and collaboration on the
  www.amnesty-volunteer.org site. I showed the site to him, explained
  our purpose, and invited him to participate in the project. He
  declined my invitation, citing that he "had to work on the AIUSA
  website." Instead, he suggested that I contact the National Field
  Program for possible materials that can be shared with the AI
  community through www.amnesty-volunteer.org. I thought we parted on
  cordial terms, although I was disappointed that he didn't wish to
  help with the amnesty-volunteer.org project.

5. After the meeting in New York, I stopped taking the initiative to
  contact JEX. However, in July of 1999, while I was in Europe
  attending an international conference and taking a holiday, JEX
  emailed HNX and me, saying that certain material on the
  www.amnesty-volunteer.org site was not appropriate and that we
  should take it down. I had set up my email account so that any
  person sending messages to me while I was away would get an
  automated reply indicating when I'd return. Instead of waiting for
  my return, JEX wrote a message to Curt and other staff complaining
  about the administrators of www.amnesty-volunteer.org. After I
  came back, the material to which he objected was taken down, and I
  sent out a message saying that, while we welcome comments from all
  AI sections, if he takes issue with the way
  www.amnesty-volunteer.org is run, instead of complaining to senior
  AIUSA staff, he should bring it up at an international forum like
  aiwww or itgen mailing list.

After that incident in August of 1999, I had no more direct contact
with JEX , although we might have had some indirect
interactions. In August of 1999, when JXB was the acting
director of the National Field Program (NFP), I contacted him to see
if I could get some materials prepared by NFP for the
amnesty-volunteer.org site. JXB was extremely helpful, and offered to
send the Activist Toolkit as soon as it had been revised for the
year. However, it wasn't until January of 2000, after JXB returned to
Washington DC, that I received the Activist Toolkit. During that time,
the personnel at NFP kept saying that, because JEX was going
to put up the Activist Toolkit on AIUSA website, I didn't need it at
amnesty-volunteer.org, and I kept explaining that
amnesty-volunteer.org is accessbile to AI members from around the
world, not just AIUSA members, and that I was willing to strip out
anything specific to AIUSA in the part of Activist Toolkit we put up.

Harassment is an extremely serious charge. That is why I am taking
time to respond to JEX 's charge. I understand that AIUSA
staff is vulnerable to ill-advised criticisms by volunteers. On the
other hand, staff members can easily discourage the involvement of
volunteers in AI's human rights work. In the six years of my
involvement in AIUSA at national level, I had a staff member who
questioned my honesty (although he later apologized), a staff who lied
to cover his mistake, another staff member who used my ethnicity in a
joke (saying that I live on "Coolie Drive" when I told her my
"Coolidge Drive" address), and a former staff who told me I shouldn't
be too close to a certain volunteer leader lest I be seen as "XXX's
toady". If I want to make public my journey from a committed member to
someone who wish to repudiate any affiliation with AIUSA, I have quite
a story to tell.

Mr. Schulz has repeated called for cooperation and collaboration
between staff and volunteers. Such exhortation needs to be backed up
with clear definitions of what staff and volunteers can expect from
each other. Without a clear code of conduct (that defines explicitly
what constitute "harassment"), and that lay out the roles of staff and
volunteers in the organization, there will continue to be
misunderstandings and ill feelings. 

I, with friends, started to work on the amnesty-volunteer.org project
after I gave up on the idea of being able to create such a resource as
part of AIUSA. In 1995, I gave detailed suggestions to the committee
preparing the Boston Action Plan (BAP) on what we needed to do to take
advantage of opportunities offered by the Internet and through
computer communicaiton. Many of my suggestions were adopted in
BAP. However, by 1997-98, the key item I wanted to see happening--a
shared online archive of Amnesty resources for volunteers that has
adequate security protection--was nowhere near being realized. The
previous AIUSA web coordinator had no concept of such a resource, and
the similar Online Activist Network proposal got mostly negative
reactions from staff who were surveyed. That's why I started the
amnesty-volunteer.org project with support of the international AI
community instead of AIUSA. I'd have done it as part of AIUSA had I
thought I could carry out such a project within AIUSA. Unfortunately,
with exceptions of a few staff members like JXB and MOR, I got mostly 
negative reactions from AIUSA staff. I lost my
confidence in the Board after seeing how it handled the consequences
of RXQ's resignation. This is in sharp contrast to the
reception that the amnesty-volunteer project received in the
international AI community. We have about 15 AI sections participating
in the project through the "gatekeeper" mechanism that we pioneered
and that has been recommended for adoption by the IS.

I don't claim that everything we've is right. We've made mistakes and
I had reported our experiences to the international AI community
through the ITGEN mailing list. After butting my head against AIUSA in
the past few years, I have given up on it. I am incredulous that
HNX still wants to serve this organization that no longer deserves
her.

Re: JEX 's resignation letter

Dear Sir:

HNX Naylor forwarded to me JEX 's resignation letter, in which
he made some comments about me and about the amnesty-volunteer.org project.
These comments reflect misunderstandings that I'd like try to clear up.
Please allow me to make the following points:

1. I am not a member of AIUSA's CCWG. I resigned from that position in
1996. I trust that JEX is aware of that.

2. I am not a member of AIUSA. I stopped paying membership due in 1998, and
the due-waiver request that I made in 1998 should have expired in 1999. Up
to now I have not publicized this fact. However, to avoid future
misunderstanding, I will make an effort to let AIUSA staff and members know
that I am no longer an AIUSA member, and, although I still perform some
group-related tasks for AIUSA Group 19, I am not doing any work for AIUSA
and do not want to be seen as a member of AIUSA.

3. I am still an Amnesty volunteer. I help to update the IS website, and 
I continue to collaborate with other Amnesty staff and volunteers on
internationally-oriented Amnesty work, including the amnesty-volunteer.org
project.

4. JEX said that 'though amnesty-volunteer.org is administered by AIUSA
members, they have portrayed this project as being outside of the
jurisdiction of AIUSA because of its "international" nature'. It is
understandable that JEX didn't know I am no longer a member of AIUSA.
Furthermore, he probably did not know that the amnesty-volunteer.org web
site is hosted on an IS computer, with an AI-Canada volunteer providing
system-administration support. He didn't know that amnesty-volunteer.org
hosts AI groups and structures from USA, Spain, Switzerland, Australian,
and United Kingdom, and THAT MOST OF THESE GROUPS UPLOAD THEIR WEB PAGES
INDEPENDENTLY, without my interventions. He didn't know that volunteers
from AIUSA, AI-UK and AI-Italy collaborated to develop the software used to
run the amnesty-volunteer.org site. If he had visited our site, he should
know that the IS, AI-UK, AI-Italy, AI-Sweden, AI-New Zealand, and AIUSA
volunteers contributed resources to the amnesty-volunteer.org site.
(Recently the AIUSA National Field Office contributed some materials, but
we have not had the chance to install those materials at the website yet.)
Members from as many as 20 AI sections and the IS are registered users of
the amnesty-volunter.org. I wish JEX had got his facts straight before
making his assertions. I don't think it is wise for AIUSA to claim
jurisdiction over an international site like amnesty-volunteer.org.

5. JEX said that we made ourselves "gatekeepers" and brokers for
information. The "gatekeepers" system is a unique feature of the
amnesty-volunteer.org designed to allow de-centralized management of users
and password WITHOUT much intervention from the site administrators.
Fifteen AI sections participate in the "gatekeeper" system. I described the
system at the 1998 international CCWG meeting, and was asked to implement
it and report our experiences to the international AI community. I did that
prior to the 1999 international CCWG meeting, and adoption of the
"gatekeeper" system by the IS was one of the recommendations of that
meeting. I am proud of the role that amnesty-volunteer.org played in
developing the "gatekeeper" system for the international AI community.

6. JEX said that I encouraged staff and members to contribute resources to
amnesty-volunter.org *instead* of the AIUSA website. I wish he had provided
evidence for that assertion. Yes, I solicited resources for the
amnesty-volunteer.org site FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHARING AMONG AI MEMBERS
AROUND THE WORLD. Amnesty-volunteer.org is not competing with any national
AI website. Contributors are free to send their materials to any other AI
structure. In fact, in the statement announcing the launch of the
amnesty-volunteer.org site, we explicitly said that, if a section website
has sufficiently secure internal area and if it will reciprocally share
resources with amnesty-volunter.org, we are happy to donate any and all
resources we've collected to that section. That's exactly the arrangement
we have with AI-Italy. We send them all amnesty-volunteer.org resources
they ask for. Thus, AI-Italy members have access to internal
amnesty-volunteer.org materials through their own website, and we are
relieved of the burden of managing AI-Italy users.

7. JEX said that, by positioning myself outside AIUSA, I am not
accountable for my actions. Since 1996, I've worked closely with the IT and
Publication Programs at the IS. The amnesty-volunteer.org site is hosted on
an IS computer. The goal of the site is to create a mechanism for AI staff
and volunteers from around the world to share AI resources. For these
reasons, I have always thought that my work on the amnesty-volunteer.org
project should be accountable to the international AI community, and to the
IS in particular.

The issue of accountability is more complicated than deciding to whom
Samson Tu should be accountable. Much of the materials at
amnesty-volunteer.org is meant for sharing among the international AI
community. On the other hand, we also host AI groups and structures that
belong to specific sections. We need to develop a system that allows
sections to monitor those parts of the amnesty-volunteer.org that relate
them and develop channels for resolving problems, given that many of the AI
groups and structures hosted at amnesty-volunteer.org manage their own
areas without intervention or even knowledge of site administrators. Had
JEX been willing, we could have a constructive dialog on these issues.

Both JEX and I have left AIUSA. I don't see any need for specific
actions regarding my relationship to AIUSA. I hope this memo clarified some
of the issues raised in JEX's letter.

JEX's letter was addressed to "Karen, Curt, and Bill." I do not know
Karen. I trust this memo will be forwarded to her.

Best regards,
Samson Tu
