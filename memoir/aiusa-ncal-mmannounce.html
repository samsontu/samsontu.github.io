Announcing Northern California Amnesty Electronic Mailing List
<p>
Ten Amnesty local groups in the San Francisco Bay area, members of
the Bay Area Development Committee, and campus groups from UC Berkeley
and Stanford University are conducting an experiment in computer
communication.  Together with the San Francisco Office, members from
these groups have joined to form the "aiusancal" electronic mailing
list.  Messages sent to the address "aiusancal@camis.stanford.edu" are
automatically redistributed to everyone on the list.
<p>
We invite the larger Amnesty community to join the experiment by
making use of the mailing list and by giving us suggestions on how to use the list. We hypothesize that the use of the mailing list will allow us to (1) share local information and resources, (2) announce local AI events (or other events of interest), (3) respond to emergency action requests, (4) request for help in group activities, and (5) coordinate regional events, media publicity, and legislative actions.  If you live in northern California, please consider joining this mailing list. If you have something to say to the Northern California Amnesty groups, send a message to "aiusancal@camis.stanford.edu".  If you have administrative questions about the list, or if you want to contact individuals from the enrolled groups, send email to me (Samson Tu of Group 19) at "tu@camis.stanford.edu".
<p>
The success of the experiment is by no mean certain. Computer
communication is not a magic wand that will create a community where
none existed before.  When there is no tradition of inter-group
communication and collaboration, the mere existence of a communication
channel will not change anything. Moreover, the use of electronic mail
is still new to many people, who are not used to write computer
messages. Typing these messages may be seen as extra work on top of
existing paper-based practices. Finally, electronic mail cannot compete with face-to-face contacts or telephone calls in developing personal relationships and in eliciting commitment. Nevertheless, even if the "aiusancal" mailing list 
does not accomplish its stated goals, we will learn important lessons from this
experiement.  We will periodically report our experiences to the Amnesty community.
