<p><b>Messages by Types</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Recommendation</b>
<ul>
<li>Beta blockers may have transient adverse effects on lipids in some patients.  Consider repeating lipid profile after maximal dosage of drug has been reached if appropriate.
<li>It is true that 7.3 inches of rain fell yesterday, and the patient is taking the following drugs: Insulin, labetalol, bumetanide, furosemide, amiodarone

</ul>
<li><b>Primary_Recommendation</b>
<ul>
<li>Recommend INTENSIFYING antihypertensive therapy: BP MARKEDLY ELEVATED based on most recent available BP; F/up 1month.
<li>DRUG DOSE information from pharmacy database is MISSING for an antihypertensive drug. Evaluate if dose increase is appropriate.
</ul>
<li><b>Assumption</b>
<ul>
<li>We did not find a BP in the vitals signs section of the computer.  We are not at present able to use the BP recorded in the text of the progress note, so we are not able to determine whether the BP control is adequate or inadequate.  Please enter BP using the top part of the screen.

We did not find a BP in the vitals signs section of the computer.  We are not at present able to use the BP recorded in the text of the progress note, so we are not able to determine whether the BP control is adequate or inadequate.  Please enter BP using the top part of the screen.
<li><b>risk group C message(on med), absence of DM <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> risk group C</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>risk group C</i>)])
This patient has clinically manifest cardiovascular disease or target organ damage (Risk Group C per JNC6).  The largest benefit of anti-hypertensive therapy is seen in patients with the highest baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, therefore this patient should be considered for prompt pharmacologic therapy, even if the BP is in the high-normal range.  Appropriate lifestyle modification and attention to other reversible cardiovascular risk factors is also strongly recommended.
<li><b>adverse event warning <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> presence of current medication with adverse reaction</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>presence of current medication with adverse reaction</i>)])
