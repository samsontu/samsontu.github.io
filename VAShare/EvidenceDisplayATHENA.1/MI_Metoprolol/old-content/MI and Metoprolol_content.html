  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of beta blockers in short term treatment 
  for acute myocardial infarction and in longer term secondary prevention; to 
  examine predictive factors that may influence outcome and therefore choice of 
  drug; and to examine the clinical importance of the results in the light of 
  current treatment. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. 
  SETTING: Randomised controlled trials. SUBJECTS: Patients with acute or past 
  myocardial infarction. Intervention: beta Blockers compared with control. MAIN 
  OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality and non-fatal reinfarction. RESULTS: Overall, 
  5477 of 54 234 patients (10.1%) randomised to beta blockers or control died. 
  We identified a 23% reduction in the odds of death in long term trials (95% 
  confidence interval 15% to 31%), but only a 4% reduction in the odds of death 
  in short term trials (-8% to 15%). Meta regression in long term trials did not 
  identify a significant reduction in effectiveness in drugs with cardioselectivity 
  but did identify a near significant trend towards decreased benefit in drugs 
  with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Most evidence is available for propranolol, 
  timolol, and metoprolol. In long term trials, the number needed to treat for 
  2 years to avoid a death is 42, which compares favourably with other treatments 
  for patients with acute or past myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: beta Blockers 
  are effective in long term secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, 
  but they are underused in such cases and lead to avoidable mortality and morbidity.

  beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) was a National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
  Institute-sponsored, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled 
  trial designed to test whether the regular administration of propranolol hydrochloride 
  to men and women who had experienced at least one myocardial infarction would 
  result in a significant reduction in total mortality during a two- to four-year 
  period. During a 27-month interval, 3,837 persons between the ages of 30 and 
  69 years were randomized to either propranolol (1,916 persons) or placebo (1,912 
  persons), five to 21 days after the infarction. Depending on serum drug levels, 
  the prescribed maintenance dose of propranolol hydrochloride was either 180 
  or 240 mg/day. The trial was stopped nine months ahead of schedule. Total mortality 
  during the average 24-month follow-up period was 7.2% in the propranolol group 
  and 9.8% in the placebo group. Arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) mortality 
  was 6.2% in the propranolol group and 8.5% in the placebo group. Sudden cardiac 
  death, a subset of ASHD mortality, was 3.3% among the propranolol patients and 
  4.6% among the placebo patients. Serious side effects were uncommon. Hypotension, 
  gastrointestinal problems, tiredness, bronchospasm, and cold hands and feet 
  occurred more frequently in the propranolol group. Based on the BHAT results, 
  the use of propranolol in patients with no contraindications to beta-blockade 
  who have had a recent myocardial infarction is recommended for at least three 
  years.</font></p>

  et Prevention Secondaire de l'Infarctus (APSI), a randomized, placebo-controlled 
  trial, was designed to test long-term acebutolol, 200 mg twice daily, a beta 
  blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, in the prevention of late 
  death in high-risk postacute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. APSI was 
  planned because patients with a death rate greater than 20% have not been enrolled 
  in significant numbers in previous trials and in such high-risk patients, it 
  remained to be proven that beta blockers have a beneficial effect. Patients 
  with an expected average risk of greater than 20% were to be selected based 
  on clinical criteria. At the time of the second interim analysis, the placebo 
  group 1-year mortality was much lower than expected (12%). The ethical board 
  recommended to stop the trial: 309 patients had been allocated to placebo, 298 
  to acebutolol. The average delay between onset of symptoms and inclusion was 
  10.5 days. The average follow-up was 318 days after inclusion. About the same 
  number of patients were discontinued from study treatment in both groups. All 
  patients were included in the analysis. There were 17 deaths in the acebutolol 
  group and 34 in the placebo group, a 48% decrease (p = 0.019). The vascular 
  mortality decreased by 58% (p = 0.006), the highest ever observed with a beta 
  blocker. All cardiovascular causes of death, including congestive heart failure, 
  were less frequent in the acebutolol group. Although the objective was not achieved, 
  APSI patients were at a higher risk than the average of the 9 previous trials 
  with beta blockers (12% instead of 7%). In addition, the total mortality reduction 
  did not decrease in 9 subgroups with increasing mortality risk from 2 to 23%. 
  APSI shows that moderately severe postAMI patients can benefit from a beta-blocking 
  treatment and a beta-blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can 
  be effective.</font></p>

  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="663333">Between 
  mid-1981 and Jan 1, 1985, 16 027 patients entering 245 coronary care units at 
  a mean of 5.0 h after the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction were 
  randomised either to a control group or to a group receiving atenolol (5-10 
  mg iv immediately, followed by 100 mg/day orally for 7 days). Vascular mortality 
  during the treatment period (days 0-7) was significantly lower (2p less than 
  0.4) in the treated group, 313/8037 (3.89%) versus 365/7990 (4.57%), but this 
  15% difference has wide 95% confidence limits (from about zero to about a quarter). 
  No subgroups were identified in which the proportional difference in days 0-7 
  was clearly better, or clearly worse, than 15%. After the treatment period, 
  there was only a slight further divergence (691 vs 703 additional vascular deaths 
  by Jan 1, 1985). Thus, overall vascular mortality was significantly lower in 
  the atenolol group at one year (life-table estimates: 10.7% atenolol vs 12.0% 
  control; 2p less than 0.01) but not at Jan 1, 1985 (crude percentages: 12.5% 
  vs 13.4%; 2p less than 0.07). However, atenolol patients were more likely than 
  controls to be discharged on beta-blockers, which can account for much of the 
  additional difference in vascular mortality after day 7. Immediate beta-blockade 
  increased the extent of inotropic drug use (5.0% vs 3.4%, 2p less than 0.0001), 
  chiefly on days 0-1, but despite this most of the improvement in vascular mortality 
  was seen during days 0-1 (121 vs 171 deaths). Treatment did not appear to decrease 
  the number in whom cardiac enzymes rose to above twice the local upper limit 
  of normal. Slightly fewer non-fatal cardiac arrests (189 vs 198) and reinfarctions 
  (148 vs 161) were recorded in the atenolol group, neither difference being significant. 
  Systematic review of fatal and of non-fatal events in ISIS-1 and in all other 
  randomised trials of iv beta-blockade reinforces the suggestion that treatment 
  reduces mortality in the first week by about 15%, but with a rather less extreme 
  effect in days 0-1 than was observed in ISIS-1 alone. It also provides highly 
  significant (2p less than 0.0002) evidence of an effect on the combined end-point 
  of death, arrest, or reinfarction, suggesting that treatment of about 200 patients 
  would lead to the avoidance of 1 reinfarction, 1 arrest, and 1 death during 
  days 0-7. ISIS-1 suggests these early gains will persist.</font></p>

  </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="663333">BACKGROUND: 
  Detection of asymptomatic ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease 
  has been associated with increased risk for adverse outcome, but treatment of 
  patients with asymptomatic ischemia remains controversial. Accordingly, the 
  purpose of this study was to determine if treatment reduces adverse outcome 
  in patients with daily life ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicenter, randomized, 
  double-blind, placebo-controlled study of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 
  outpatients with daily life silent ischemia due to coronary artery disease was 
  conducted. The primary outcome measure was event-free survival at 1 year by 
  Kaplan-Meier analysis. Events were death, resuscitated ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, 
  myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, aggravation of angina, 
  or revascularization. The secondary outcome was ischemia during ambulatory ECG 
  monitoring at 4 weeks. Three hundred six outpatients with mild or no angina 
  (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class I or II), abnormal exercise tests, and 
  ischemia on ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive either atenolol 
  (100 mg/d) or placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment, the number (mean +/- SD, 
  3.6 +/- 4.2 versus 1.7 +/- 4.6 episodes, P &lt; .001) and average duration (30 
  +/- 3.3 versus 16.4 +/- 6.7 minutes, P &lt; .001) of ischemic episodes per 48 
  hours of ambulatory monitoring decreased in atenolol- compared with placebo-assigned 
  patients (4.4 +/- 4.6 to 3.1 +/- 6.0 episodes and 36.6 +/- 4.1 to 30 +/- 5.5 
  minutes). Event-free survival improved in atenolol-treated patients (P &lt; 
  .0066), who had an increased time to onset of first adverse event (120 versus 
  79 days) and fewer total first events compared with placebo (relative risk, 
  0.44; 95% confidence intervals, 0.26 to 0.75; P = .001). There was a nonsignificant 
  trend for fewer serious events (death, resuscitation from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, 
  nonfatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina) in atenolol-treated 
  patients (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence intervals, 0.22 to 1.33; P = .175). 
  The most powerful univariate and multivariate correlate of event-free survival 
  was absence of ischemia on ambulatory monitoring at 4 weeks. Side effects were 
  mild and generally similar comparing atenolol- and placebo-treated patients, 
  although bradycardia was more frequent with atenolol. CONCLUSIONS: Atenolol 
  treatment reduced daily life ischemia and was associated with reduced risk for 
  adverse outcome in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients compared with 
  placebo.</font><font color="663333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="663333">In 
  the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase II trial, patients received 
  intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and were randomized 
  to either a conservative or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects 
  of immediate versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients 
  eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of which 720 were 
  randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 714 to the deferred group. 
  In the immediate intravenous group, within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol 
  was given (5 mg intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total 
  intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours in the first 
  24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). The patients assigned 
  to the deferred group received metoprolol, 50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed 
  by 100 mg orally twice a day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both 
  groups and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at hospital 
  discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical in the two groups. The 
  regional ventricular function was also similar in the two groups. Overall, there 
  was no difference in mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred 
  groups, but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 6 weeks 
  among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in contrast to seven deaths 
  among those in whom beta-blocker therapy was deferred. These findings for a 
  secondary end point in a subgroup were not considered sufficient to warrant 
  a recommendation regarding clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction 
  (2.7% versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 24.1%, p 
  less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous group. Thus, in appropriate 
  postinfarction patients, beta-blockers are safe when given early after thrombolytic 
  therapy and are associated with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction 
  in the first week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving 
  ventricular function or reducing mortality.</font></p>

  beta blockade but with large confidence limits. This study assessed and compared 
  the effects of early intravenous atenolol and control treatment in the first 
  week and first year after acute myocardial infarction in 16,027 patients. The 
  principal endpoint was vascular death; most of the 15% decrease in mortality 
  occurred in the first 24 to 36 hours with a significant difference at 1 week 
  (313 vs 365 deaths in the atenolol and control groups, respectively). There 
  was no rebound effect after stopping treatment after 7 days. Mortality at 1 
  year also showed a significant difference in favor of the atenolol group. Subgroup 
  analysis found no significant difference in mortality by age, sex, initial heart 
  rate, diabetes or entry electrocardiogram but data-derived analysis revealed 
  a highly significant decrease in mortality if treatment began within 2 hours 
  of the onset of pain. There was a significant 1% to 2% excess in inotrope use 
  in the atenolol group in the first 36 hours, and first-degree heart block and 
  bundle branch block emerged as relative contraindications to this treatment. 
  The results suggest that early intravenous beta blockade in acute myocardial

  postdischarge oral beta blockade therapy.</font></p>

  OBJECTIVE--To investigate the effects of prophylactic therapy with antiarrhythmic 
  agents on mortality in patients with myocardial infarction. DATA SOURCES AND 
  STUDY SELECTION--Data were obtained from all completed, published or unpublished, 
  randomized, parallel controlled trials of antiarrhythmic agents, regardless 
  of sample size. Investigators were contacted for data on patients excluded after 
  randomization. DATA EXTRACTION--Data on mortality were extracted by one author 
  and confirmed where necessary by the others. DATA SYNTHESIS--Mortality data 
  from 138 trials on 98,000 patients were combined by the Yusuf-Peto adaptation 
  of the Mantel-Haenszel method. There were 660 deaths among 11,712 patients allocated 
  to receive class I agents and 571 deaths among 11,517 corresponding control 
  patients (51 trials: odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 
  to 1.28; P = .03). Of 26,973 patients allocated to receive beta-blockers (class 
  II agents), 1464 died compared with 1727 deaths among 26,295 control patients 
  (55 trials: OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.87; P = .00001). Of 778 patients allocated 
  to receive amiodarone (a class III agent), 77 died compared with 101 deaths 
  in 779 control patients (eight trials: OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.97; P = .03). 
  There were 982 deaths in 10,154 patients allocated to receive a class IV agent 
  (calcium channel blockers) and 949 deaths in 10,188 control patients (24 trials: 
  OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.14; P = .41). CONCLUSIONS--The routine use of class 
  I antiarrhythmic agents after myocardial infarction is associated with increased 
  mortality. beta-Blockers have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce mortality. 
  The limited data on amiodarone appear promising. Data on calcium channel blockers

  or lesser extent from beta-blocker therapy than the average patient population. 
  One-year all-cause mortality data from nine trials involving 13,679 patients 
  were obtained. Overall, mortality was 24% lower in the beta-blocker group compared 
  to the placebo group. However, there was heterogeneity among the results of 
  the trials, which tested seven different beta-blockers. Subgroups with high 
  placebo group mortality (e.g. patients with a history of previous myocardial 
  infarction (MI), angina pectoris, mechanical or electrical complications, and 
  digitalis usage) seemed to benefit particularly from beta-blocker treatment. 
  These findings were consistent in the nine trials. Patients in the lower risk 
  subgroups also appeared to benefit from beta-blockers, but this benefit was 
  smaller in absolute terms and inconsistent across the trials. There was no evidence 
  that treatment outcome was related to gender, baseline level of heart rate or 
  blood pressure, or time of initiation of treatment after hospital admission. 
  In conclusion, the Pooling Project indicates that high risk MI patients, without

  Long-term beta blockade for perhaps a year or so following discharge after an 
  MI is now of proven value, and for many such patients mortality reductions of 
  about 25% can be achieved. No important differences are clearly apparent among 
  the benefits of different beta blockers, although some are more convenient than 
  others (or have slightly fewer side effects), and it appears that those with 
  appreciable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may confer less benefit. If monitored, 
  the side effects of long-term therapy are not a major problem, as when they 
  occur they are easily reversible by changing the beta blocker or by discontinuation 
  of treatment. By contrast, although very early IV short-term beta blockade can 
  definitely limit infarct size, more reliable information about the effects of 
  such treatment on mortality will not be available until a large trial (ISIS) 
  reports later this year, with data on some thousands of patients entered within 
  less than 4 hours of the onset of pain. Our aim has been not only to review 
  the 65-odd randomized beta blocker trials but also to demonstrate that when 
  many randomized trials have all applied one general approach to treatment, it 
  is often not appropriate to base inference on individual trial results. Although 
  there will usually be important differences from one trial to another (in eligibility, 
  treatment, end-point assessment, and so on), physicians who wish to decide whether 
  to adopt a particular treatment policy should try to make their decision in 
  the light of an overview of all these related randomized trials and not just 
  a few particular trial results. Although most trials are too small to be individually 
  reliable, this defect of size may be rectified by an overview of many trials, 
  as long as appropriate statistical methods are used. Fortunately, robust statistical 
  methods exist--based on direct, unweighted summation of one O-E value from each 
  trial--that are simple for physicians to use and understand yet provide full 
  statistical sensitivity. These methods allow combination of information from 
  different trials while avoiding the unjustified direct comparison of patients 
  in one trial with patients in another. (Moreover, they can be extended of such 
  data that there is no real need for the introduction of any more complex statistical 
  methods that might be more difficult for physicians to trust.) Their robustness, 
  sensitivity, and avoidance of unnecessary complexity make these particular methods 
  an important tool in trial overviews.</font></p>
