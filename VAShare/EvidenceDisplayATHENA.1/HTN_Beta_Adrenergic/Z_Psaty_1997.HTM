<HR SIZE=2 COLOR=#3399CC>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Objective</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">To determine the effectiveness of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents to prevent major disease end points.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Data sources</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Randomized controlled trials were identified by searching the MEDLINE database (1980 to 1995) based on the terms (cerebrovascular diseases or heart diseases) and randomized controlled trial and (antihypertensive agents [therapeutic use] or hypertension [drug therapy]). Additional articles were identified by scanning bibliographies of relevant review articles.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Study selection</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Trials were selected if they were &ge; 1 year in duration; were placebo controlled; used diuretic therapy, &beta;-blocker therapy, calcium channel blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as antihypertensive agents; were unconfounded by other therapies; and assessed major disease end points. Trials were excluded if they were multiple risk factor intervention trials, used other antihypertensive therapies, or compared &beta;-blocker therapy with diuretic therapy.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Data extraction</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Data were extracted on treatment strategy, patient numbers, duration of the trial, coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, total mortality, and cardiovascular death.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main results</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">18 trials involving 48 220 patients met the selection criteria. All 18 trials were included in previous reviews and evaluated diuretic therapy or b-blocker therapy. No trials evaluating calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were found. Trials were classified according to 3 treatment strategies: high-dose diuretic therapy (&ge; equivalent of 50 mg of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide), low-dose diuretic therapy (equivalent of 12.5 to 25 mg/d of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide), and &beta;-blocker therapy. High-dose diuretic therapy reduced stroke {<I>P</I> &lt; 0.001}*, congestive heart failure {<I>P</I> &lt; 0.001}*, and cardiovascular death (<I>P</I> = 0.03). Low-dose diuretic therapy reduced stroke {<I>P</I> &lt; 0.001}*, coronary heart disease {<I>P </I>&lt; 0.001}*, congestive heart failure {<I>P </I>&lt; 0.001}*, mortality (<I>P </I>= 0.04), and cardiovascular death (<I>P </I>&lt; 0.001). &beta;-blocker therapy reduced stroke {<I>P </I>&lt; 0.05}* and congestive heart failure {<I>P </I>&lt; 0.005}*. {However, the absolute risk reductions were small (&le; 2.5%), thereby indicating numbers needed to treat over 40.}*</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Conclusions</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Diuretics and &beta;-blockers used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension reduce the risk for stroke and congestive heart failure. In addition, low-dose diuretics reduce the risk for coronary heart disease and total mortality.</p>

<P CLASS="CmHd">Commentary</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">The results of the review by Psaty and colleagues represent part of a paper that aims to answer the following question: Regarding health outcomes, which antihypertensive therapies qualify to be used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension? These investigators have also reviewed clinical trials in hypertension that evaluate surrogate end points (the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study, a Veterans Affairs trial, and the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study), clinical trials of secondary prevention (calcium channel blockers for coronary heart disease and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for congestive heart failure), and observational studies. Psaty and colleagues conclude that diuretic therapy and &beta;-blocker therapy are the only proven first-line agents for hypertension. </p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">On the basis of results from large clinical trials, the authors consider both &beta;-blocker therapy and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for patients with coronary heart disease and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure to be &quot;special indications.&quot; It is also worth emphasizing that the effectiveness of a low-dose diuretic-based antihypertensive strategy in the elderly is indisputable: 40 to 50 patients would need to be treated with low-dose diuretics for 5 years to prevent 1 additional major cardiovascular event, and 71 patients would need to be treated for 5 years to prevent 1 additional death (95% CI 37 to 717). Conclusions were independent of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Study results (1) and confirmed 2 other reviews not cited in this paper (2, 3).</p>
