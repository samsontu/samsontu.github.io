    </font><font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OBJECTIVE: 
    To assess the effect of low-dose, diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment 
    on major cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rates in older, non-insulin-treated 
    diabetic patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), compared with 
    nondiabetic patients. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
    trial: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). SETTING: Multiple 
    clinical and support centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 
    4736 men and women aged 60 years and older at baseline with ISH (systolic 
    blood pressure [BP], &gt; or = 160 mm Hg; diastolic BP, &lt;90 mm Hg) at baseline, 
    583 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients and 4149 nondiabetic patients 
    (4 additional patients not so classifiable were randomized but not included 
    in these analyses). Diabetes mellitus defined as physician diagnosis, taking 
    oral hypoglycemic drugs, fasting glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L or more (&gt; 
    or = 140 mg/dL), or any combination of these characteristics. INTERVENTION: 
    The active treatment group received a low dose of chlorthalidone (12.5-25.0 
    mg/d) with a step-up to atenolol (25.0-50.0 mg/d) or reserpine (0.05-0.10 
    mg/d) if needed. The placebo group received placebo and any active antihypertensive 
    drugs prescribed by patient's private physician for persistently high BP. 
    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 5-year rates of major CVD events, nonfatal plus 
    fatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and fatal coronary heart 
    disease (CHD), major CHD events, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The SHEP 
    antihypertensive drug regimen lowered BP of both diabetic and nondiabetic 
    patients, with few adverse effects. For both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, 
    all outcome rates were lower for participants randomized to the active treatment 
    group than for those randomized to the placebo group. Thus, 5-year major CVD 
    rate was lower by 34% for active treatment compared with placebo, both for 
    diabetic patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 6%-54%) and nondiabetic patients 
    (95% CI, 21%-45%). Absolute risk reduction with active treatment compared 
    with placebo was twice as great for diabetic vs nondiabetic patients (101/1000 
    vs 51/1000 randomized participants at the 5-year follow-up), reflecting the 
    higher risk of diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Low-dose diuretic-based (chlorthalidone) 
    treatment is effective in preventing major CVD events, cerebral and cardiac, 
    in both non-insulin-treated diabetic and nondiabetic older patients with ISH.
