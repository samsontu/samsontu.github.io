Patients with HF may have symptoms that interfere with their daily activities and, therefore, impact on their quality of life. A diuretic should be used for preload reduction in patients with HF and current or previous signs or symptoms of volume overload (e.g., orthopnea, PND, DOE, or edema)		Patients with HF may have symptoms that interfere with their daily activities and, therefore, impact on their quality of life.
