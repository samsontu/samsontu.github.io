<bold>Action Choices</bold>
<ul>
<li><b>on medication: things to check</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>assumption no dx hypertension  <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
If this patient does not have hypertension, or if this patient already has a diagnosis of secondary hypertension on the problem list, please take a moment to tell us that, using the "comment" box at the bottom of the recommendations screen.  You can also send us an email, if you like, in DHCP (VA Palo Alto): Susana Martins (Susana.Martins@med.va). You can open DHCP to send email without closing your CPRS-GUI window.
<li><b>assumption exclusion <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
This program does NOT provide recommendations for patients with SECONDARY HYPERTENSION, NARCOLEPSY, ASCITES, SPINAL-CORD INJURY , or IDIOPATHIC HYPERTHROPHIC SUBAORTIC STENOSIS. If this patient has one or more of these diagnoses, please ADD it to the patient's PROBLEM LIST.
<li><b>assumption Update BP, on meds <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
A BP entered into the ATHENA system today will not be entered into the patient's electronic medical record.  The program will use the BP to update the recommendations on the screen, but it will not write the BP to VistA, so the BP will not show up in   CPRS-GUI.  You can enter additional BP's into the patient's permanent medical record by clicking 'BP' in the Vitals box on the CPRS-GUI main screen.  Click 'Enter Vitals' in the top left of the screen, select the appropriate appointment location, and then enter the new blood pressure at the prompt.  Any BP you add to the patient's medical record today will be available to this program at the patient's next visit. The ATHENA system will have a write-back feature implemented in the near future that will allow you to write BP's you enter in ATHENA to CPRS.
<li><b>assumption disclaimer about procedure reports <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
Diagnoses from procedure reports (EKG, X-ray, etc.) are not recognizable to ATHENA DSS.  ATHENA pulls diagnoses from the problem list and the list of diagnoses for each visit on the encounter forms.  The Patient Summary in ATHENA shows the diagnoses for this patient that are known to the program. If patient has a diagnosis that is not included in the Patient Summary, please update the problem list, or include the diagnosis on today's encounter form.
<li><b>assumption Disclaimer, on meds <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
Recommendations of the ATHENA DSS must be considered in the context of full information about the patient and the clinician-patient interaction.  The final responsibility for medical management rests with the prescribing/treating clinician (physician or nurse practitioner).  While we have made every effort to ensure that the recommendations generated by ATHENA DSS reflect the current evidence for management of hypertension, we cannot guarantee that the program will generate a recommendation for the best treatment in all cases.  Please use your clinical judgment in evaluating recommendations from ATHENA DSS.  If you see recommendations that you believe represent errors in the program, please call them to our attention.
<li><b>Assumption drug dosage <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
Daily dosage calculation is based on the following formula:  [(strength of dosage form) x (number of dosage forms)]/days supply. If extra dosage forms (tablets) are dispensed there may be an overestimation of actual daily dose.  The calculated daily dose is displayed in the patient summary.
<li><b>assumption about prescriptions <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
If a prescription expires, it will not appear on the active medication list though the patient may still be taking the medication.  This will be reflected correctly in the prescription graph (see BP-Prescription Graphs tab).  
<li><b>ADR to drug with active prescription <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> Taking 1 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
<li><b>adverse event warning <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> presence of current medication with adverse reaction</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>presence of current medication with adverse reaction</i>)])
<li><b>secondary prevention HF (no ACE or ARB) <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> HF and not (ACE or ARB)</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Absence of ARB && ACE I not being used && presence of heart failure && ACE I adverse reaction</i>)])
Use of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure and ejection fraction <0.35 significantly reduces overall mortality and hospital admissions.  For patients with ejection fraction >=0.35 ACE inhibitors may be beneficial but this is not established.
<li><b>gout and thiazides <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> gout and thiazides</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>presence of Gout && thiazide diuretics being used</i>)])
Thiazides may increase uric acid levels and induce an acute gout attack. Evaluate clinically.
<li><b>Combination therapy <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> taking 2 or more antihypertensive agents</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Antihypertensive_Agents</i>)])
There is not much information on combination therapy for hypertension. If BP is not controlled after 3 months at maximum tolerated dose we suggest substituting one or more drugs.
<li><b>On beta blocker hyperlipidemia <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> beta blocker being used</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>beta blocker being used</i>)])
Beta blockers may have transient adverse effects on lipids in some patients.  Consider repeating lipid profile after maximal dosage of drug has been reached if appropriate.
<li><b>risk group C message(on med), absence of DM <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> risk group C</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>risk group C</i>)])
This patient has clinically manifest cardiovascular disease or target organ damage (Risk Group C per JNC6).  The largest benefit of anti-hypertensive therapy is seen in patients with the highest baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, therefore this patient should be considered for prompt pharmacologic therapy, even if the BP is in the high-normal range.  Appropriate lifestyle modification and attention to other reversible cardiovascular risk factors is also strongly recommended.
<li><b>on hctz <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> HCTZ<=25mg and Cr<=2.0</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>HCTZ >25mg && Creatinine(1.8/2006-1-2) && presence of thiazide diuretics</i>)])
HCTZ dose above 25 mg doesn't add to BP control for most patients and may lead to hypokalemia.
<li><b>Creatinine>uln males <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> creatinine>1.5 and male</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>Creatinine(1.8/2006-1-2) && Sex(Male)</i>)])
Warning: creatinine value is greater than 1.5 mg/dL, upper limit of normal for males.
<li><b>Assumptions <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> presence of diagnosis of hypertension</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>presence of diagnosis of hypertension</i>)])
The eGFR is calculated based on the most recent serum creatinine.
<li><b>test parameterized message <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> true</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i></i>)])
It is true that  inches of rain fell yesterday, and the patient is taking the following drugs: atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide
<li><b>Orthostatic hypotension risk <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> postural hypotension risk</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i>presence of HCTZ</i>)])
Patients with Active prescription for thiazide, Age > 65 diagnosis are at higher risk of postural hypotension. Check orthostatic BP.
<li><b>Disclaimer <font color=FF0000>preferred</font></b>(rule in criterion<i> true</i> evaluate to <b> true</b> because <i></i>)])
