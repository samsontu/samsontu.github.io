<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><b>Allocation concealed</b>: The authors were deemed to have 
  taken adequate measures to conceal allocation to study groups from those responsible 
  for assessing patients for entry in the trial (e.g., central randomization; 
  numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; sealed envelopes from a closed bag; numbered 
  or coded bottles or containers; drugs prepared by the pharmacy; or other descriptions 
  that contain elements convincing of concealment).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><b>Allocation not concealed</b>: The authors were deemed not 
  to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation to study groups from those 
  responsible for assessing patients for entry in the trial (e.g., no concealment 
  procedure, sealed envelopes that were not opaque, or other descriptions that 
  contain elements not convincing of concealment).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><b>Unclear allocation concealment</b>: The authors did not report 
  or provide us with a description of an allocation concealment approach that 
  allowed for classification as concealed or not concealed.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><b>Blinded</b>: Any or all of the clinicians, patients or participants, 
  outcome assessors, or statisticians were unaware of who received which study 
  intervention. Those that are blinded are indicated in parentheses. If &quot;initially&quot; 
  is indicated (e.g., blinded [patients and outcome assessor initially]), the 
  code was broken during the trial, for instance, because of adverse effects.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><b>Blinded (unclear)</b>: The authors did not report or provide 
  us with an indication of who, if anyone, was unaware of who received which study 
  intervention.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><b>Unblinded</b>: All participants in the trial (clinicians, 
  patients or participants, outcome assessors, and statisticians) were aware of 
  who received which study intervention.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Definitions relating to data presentation in therapeutics<br>
</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">We will discuss 2 examples to define the terms we use to denote 
  the efficacy of treatments (1). First, for intensive therapy for diabetes mellitus 
  (DM), the experimental event rate (EER) for neuropathy was 3% compared with 
  the control event rate (CER) of 10% (2). Second, the home delivery of thrombolysis 
  for myocardial infarction (MI) led to 83% survival at 30 months compared with 
  68% survival for delivery after transfer to hospital (3). We can then generate 
  the measures below. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">1. When the experimental treatment reduces the risk for a bad event:</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>RRR (relative risk reduction):</B> the proportional reduction in rates of bad events between experimental and control participants in a trial, calculated as |EER - CER|/CER and accompanied by a 95% confidence interval (CI). In the DM example, |EER - CER|/CER = |3% - 10%|/10% = 70%, CI 34% to 87%.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>ARR (absolute risk reduction):</B> the absolute arithmetic difference in event rates, |EER - CER|. In the DM example, |EER - CER| = |3% - 10%| = 7%.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>NNT (number needed to treat):</B> the number of patients who need to be treated to achieve one additional favourable outcome. Reported as a whole number, calculated as 1/ARR, rounded up to the next highest whole number, and accompanied by its 95% CI. In the DM example, for neuropathy, 1/ARR = 1/7% = 14.3, rounded up to 15, 95% CI 9 to 35. Readers can convert this to an NNT for a specific patient by estimating that patient's susceptibility (patient expected event rate, or PEER, also called the patient-specific baseline risk) relative to the average control patient in the trial report, expressed as a decimal fraction (F) and then dividing the reported NNT by F. In the example, if a patient was judged to be half as susceptible as the average control patient, F = 0.5 and NNT/F = 15/0.5 = 30, then 30 such patients would need to be treated to prevent 1 additional event.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">2. When the experimental treatment increases the probability of a good event:</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>RBI (relative benefit increase):</B> the increase in the rates of good events, comparing experimental and control patients in a trial, also calculated as |EER - CER|/CER. In the MI example, |EER - CER|/CER = |83% - 68%|/68% = 22%. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>ABI (absolute benefit increase):</B> the absolute arithmetic difference in event rates, |EER - CER|. In the MI example, |EER - CER| = |83% - 68%| = 15%.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>NNT:</B> this is calculated as above, 1/15% = 7, and denotes the number of people who must receive the experimental treatment to create one additional improved outcome in comparison with the control treatment.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">3. When the experimental treatment increases the probability of a bad event: </p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>RRI (relative risk increase):</B> the increase in rates of bad events, comparing experimental patients to control patients in a trial, and calculated as for RBI. RRI is also used in assessing the impact of risk factors for disease. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>ARI (absolute risk increase):</B> the absolute difference in rates of bad events, when the experimental treatment harms more patients than the control treatment. ARI is also used in assessing the effect of risk factors for disease.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>NNH (number needed to harm):</B> the number of patients who, 
  if they received the experimental treatment, would lead to 1 additional person 
  being harmed compared with patients who receive the control treatment, and calculated 
  as 1/ARI.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Confidence intervals</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">The confidence interval (CI) quantifies uncertainty (4). The 
  95% CI is the range of values within which we can be 95% sure that the true 
  value lies for the whole population of patients from whom the study patients 
  were selected. The CI narrows as the number of patients on which it is based 
  increases. We prefer CIs to P values because the former tell us about the strength 
  of evidence, whereas the latter merely test it against a no difference (null) 
  hypothesis.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Odds ratio</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">When used to summarise a systematic review or an individual 
  study of treatment, an odds ratio (OR) describes the odds of a patient in an 
  experimental group having an outcome event relative to a patient in a control 
  group (5). For example, 100 patients (a + b) receive an experimental treatment 
  and 20 of them (a) experience an event, while 80 do not (b), whereas 100 patients 
  (c + d) receive a control treatment and 40 have an event (c), while 60 do not 
  (d). The odds in the experimental group is (a/b =) 0.25, the odds in the control 
  group is (c/d =) 0.67, and the odds ratio is [(a/b)/(c/d) = 0.25/0.67)] = 0.37. 
  Note that the odds ratio looks like a relative risk, but it is numerically similar 
  only when event rates are very low. Thus, the relative risk for the example 
  is [a/(a + b) &divide; c/(c + d) = 20/100 &divide; (40/100 =)] 0.50. If the 
  event rates were 1% and 2%, the RR would still be 0.5, and the OR would be (1/99 
  &divide; (2/98 =) 0.49. The OR is also used in other comparative studies, for 
  example, of diagnosis, prognosis, or etiology.</p>

<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Sensitivity:</B> the proportion of patients with the target disorder who have a positive test result (a/[a + c]) (Figure 1).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Specificity:</B> the proportion of patients without the target disorder who have a negative test result (d/[b + d]) (Figure 1).</p>

<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Figure 1.</B> Comparison of test results with a diagnostic standard.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Pretest probability (prevalence):</B> the proportion of patients who have the target disorder, as determined before the test is carried out ([a + c]/[a + b + c + d]) (Figure 1).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Pretest odds:</B> the odds that the patient has the target disorder before the test is carried out (pretest probability/[1 &ndash; pretest probability]).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Likelihood ratio (LR):</B> the ratio of the probability of a test result among patients with the target disorder to the probability of that same test result among patients who are free of the target disorder. The LR for a positive test is calculated as sensitivity/(1 - specificity). The LR for a negative test is calculated as (1 - sensitivity)/specificity.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Post-test odds:</B> the odds that the patient has the target disorder after the test is carried out (pretest odds <font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:Symbol">&#180;</span></font> LR).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>Post-test probability:</B> the proportion of patients with that particular test result who have the target disorder (post-test odds/[1 + post-test odds]). Use of the nomogram (<a href="#figure2.nomogramforinterpretingdiagnostictestresults.">Figure 2</a>) avoids the need for these calculations: Anchor a straight edge on the left-hand column at the appropriate pretest probability and direct it through the central column at the value of the LR. The approximate post-test probability can be read off the right-hand column.</p>

<P CLASS="AbsHd">Terms used in etiology</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"><B>AR (attributable risk)</B>: a measure of association, influenced by the frequency of a characteristic in the population. It is the maximum proportion of a disease that can be attributed to a characteristic or etiologic factor. It is expressed as:</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">AR = b(r-1)/b(r-1)+1 <font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:Symbol">&#180;</span></font> 100</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">where r = the relative risk and b = proportion of the total population classified as having the characteristic. AR can also be calculated as:</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">AR = IE - Inon-E</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">where IE = incidence in exposed persons and Inon-E = incidence nonexposed persons.</p>

<P CLASS="CmRefHd">How to Find the Best External Evidence through a Computer Search</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">This part of the glossary summarises the most effective search strategies for identifying the best evidence available through a computer search of the medical literature. They have been developed for use on the U.S. National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE system, and combine index terms (MeSH terms) for the condition or disease of interest with methodologic terms from evidence-based medicine.</p>
