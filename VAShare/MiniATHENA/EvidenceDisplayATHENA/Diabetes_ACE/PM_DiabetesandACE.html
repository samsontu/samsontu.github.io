                    To analyze the available data to assess the benefits of antihypertensive 
                    therapy in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: 
                    A MEDLINE search of English-language articles published until 
                    June 1999 was undertaken with the use of the terms diabetes 
                    mellitus, hypertension or blood pressure, and therapy. Pertinent 
                    articles cited in the identified reports were also reviewed. 
                    Included were only prospective randomized studies of more 
                    than 12 months' duration that evaluated the effect of drug 
                    treatment on morbidity and mortality in diabetic hypertensive 
                    patients. We estimated the risk associated with combination 
                    of diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the effect of treatment 
                    on morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: The coexistence of diabetes 
                    mellitus doubled the risk of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular 
                    mortality, and total mortality in hypertensive patients (approximate 
                    relative risk of 1.73-2.77 for cardiovascular events, 2.25-3.66 
                    for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.73-2.18 for total mortality). 
                    Intensive blood pressure control to levels lower than 130/85 
                    mm Hg was beneficial in diabetic hypertensive patients. All 
                    4 drug classes-diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting 
                    enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists-were effective 
                    in reducing cardiovascular events in diabetic hypertensive 
                    patients. In elderly diabetic patients with isolated systolic 
                    hypertension, calcium antagonists reduced the rate of cardiac 
                    end points by 63%, stroke by 73%, and total mortality by 55%. 
                    In more than 60% of diabetic hypertensive patients, combination 
                    therapy was required to control blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: 
                    Intensive control of blood pressure reduced cardiovascular 
                    morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients regardless of 
                    whether low-dose diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting 
                    enzyme inhibitors, or calcium antagonists were used as a first-line 
                    treatment. A combination of more than 1 drug is frequently 
                    required to control blood pressure and may be more beneficial 
                    than monotherapy. [<a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_GROSSMAN2000.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See

                  Despite treatment, there is often a higher incidence of cardiovascular 
                  complications in patients with hypertension than in normotensive 
                  individuals. Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is 
                  a likely cause, but the optimum target blood pressure is not 
                  known. The impact of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has never 
                  been investigated in patients with hypertension. We aimed to 
                  assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential 
                  benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment 
                  of hypertension. METHODS: 18790 patients, from 26 countries, 
                  aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension and diastolic 
                  blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg (mean 105 mm 
                  Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 
                  6264 patients were allocated to the target pressure &lt; or 
                  =90 mm Hg, 6264 to &lt; or =85 mm Hg, and 6262 to &lt; or =80 
                  mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with the addition 
                  of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 
                  9399 patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic 
                  acid (Bamycor, Astra) and 9391 patients were assigned placebo. 
                  FINDINGS: Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 
                  22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the &lt; or =90 mm Hg, &lt; or 
                  =85 mm Hg, and &lt; or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. 
                  The lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events occurred 
                  at a mean achieved diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the 
                  lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at 86.5 mm 
                  Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. 
                  In patients with diabetes mellitus there was a 51% reduction 
                  in major cardiovascular events in target group &lt; or =80 mm 
                  Hg compared with target group &lt; or =90 mm Hg (p for trend=0.005). 
                  Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 
                  15% (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36% (p=0.002), 
                  with no effect on stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the 
                  acetylsalicylic acid group and eight in the placebo group, and 
                  129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups, respectively 
                  (p&lt;0.001). INTERPRETATION: Intensive lowering of blood pressure 
                  in patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate 
                  of cardiovascular events. The HOT Study shows the benefits of 
                  lowering the diastolic blood pressure down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic 
                  acid significantly reduced major cardiovascular events with 
                  the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial infarction. There 
                  was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but 
                  non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common. <br>

                  Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular 
                  and renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
                  (ACE) inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with 
                  diabetes. METHODS: 3577 people with diabetes included in the 
                  Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, aged 55 years or 
                  older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one 
                  other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart 
                  failure, or low ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE 
                  inhibitors, were randomly assigned ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, 
                  and vitamin E or placebo, according to a two-by-two factorial 
                  design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial infarction, 
                  stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main 
                  outcome in a substudy. FINDINGS: The study was stopped 6 months 
                  early (after 4.5 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring 
                  board because of a consistent benefit of ramipril compared with 
                  placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome 
                  by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction by 22% 
                  (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), 
                  total mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), 
                  and overt nephropathy by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment 
                  for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) and diastolic (1.0 mm 
                  Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the 
                  combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). INTERPRETATION: 
                  Ramipril was beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt 
                  nephropathy in people with diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit 
                  was greater than that attributable to the decrease in blood 
                  pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and 
                  renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.<br>

                  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tight control of blood pressure 
                  prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients 
                  with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial comparing 
                  tight control of blood pressure aiming at a blood pressure of 
                  &lt;150/85 mm Hg (with the use of an angiotensin converting

                  of &lt;180/105 mm Hg. SETTING: 20 hospital based clinics in 
                  England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS: 1148 hypertensive 
                  patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean blood pressure 
                  at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight 
                  control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control 
                  with a median follow up of 8.4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
                  Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal, related 
                  to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. 
                  Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary 
                  albumin excretion and retinal photography. RESULTS: Mean blood 
                  pressure during follow up was significantly reduced in the group 
                  assigned tight blood pressure control (144/82 mm Hg) compared 
                  with the group assigned to less tight control (154/87 mm Hg) 
                  (P&lt;0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight 
                  control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 
                  24% in diabetes related end points (95% confidence interval 
                  8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths related to diabetes (6% 
                  to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013), and 
                  37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly 
                  owing to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was 
                  a non-significant reduction in all cause mortality. After nine 
                  years of follow up the group assigned to tight blood pressure 
                  control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the proportion of 
                  patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99% 
                  confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced 
                  risk (7% to 70%) (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity 
                  by three lines of the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy 
                  study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of patients 
                  in the group assigned to tight control required three or more 
                  treatments to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. 
                  CONCLUSION: Tight blood pressure control in patients with hypertension 
                  and type 2 diabetes achieves a clinically important reduction 
                  in the risk of deaths related to diabetes, complications related 
                  to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and deterioration 
                  in visual acuity. [<a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_UKPDS38.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=650,height=500')">See

                <p align="left"><font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OBJECTIVE: 
                  To determine whether tight control of blood pressure with either 
                  a beta blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 
                  has a specific advantage or disadvantage in preventing the macrovascular 
                  and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: 
                  Randomised controlled trial comparing an angiotensin converting 
                  enzyme inhibitor (captopril) with a beta blocker (atenolol) 
                  in patients with type 2 diabetes aiming at a blood pressure 
                  of &lt;150/&lt;85 mm Hg. SETTING: 20 hospital based clinics 
                  in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS: 1148 hypertensive 
                  patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56 years, mean blood 
                  pressure 160/94 mm Hg). Of the 758 patients allocated to tight 
                  control of blood pressure, 400 were allocated to captopril and 
                  358 to atenolol. 390 patients were allocated to less tight control 
                  of blood pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predefined clinical 
                  end points, fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, death 
                  related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. Surrogate measures 
                  of microvascular and macrovascular disease included urinary 
                  albumin excretion and retinopathy assessed by retinal photography. 
                  RESULTS: Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing 
                  blood pressure to a mean of 144/83 mm Hg and 143/81 mm Hg respectively, 
                  with a similar proportion of patients (27% and 31%) requiring 
                  three or more antihypertensive treatments. More patients in 
                  the captopril group than the atenolol group took the allocated 
                  treatment: at their last clinic visit, 78% of those allocated 
                  captopril and 65% of those allocated atenolol were taking the 
                  drug (P&lt;0.0001). Captopril and atenolol were equally effective 
                  in reducing the risk of macrovascular end points. Similar proportions 
                  of patients in the two groups showed deterioration in retinopathy 
                  by two grades after nine years (31% in the captopril group and 
                  37% in the atenolol group) and developed clinical grade albuminuria 
                  &gt;=300 mg/l (5% and 9%). The proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic 
                  attacks was not different between groups, but mean weight gain 
                  in the atenolol group was greater (3.4 kg v 1.6 kg). CONCLUSION: 
                  Blood pressure lowering with captopril or atenolol was similarly 
                  effective in reducing the incidence of diabetic complications. 
                  This study provided no evidence that either drug has any specific 
                  beneficial or deleterious effect, suggesting that blood pressure 
                  reduction in itself may be more important than the treatment 
                  used.<br>
