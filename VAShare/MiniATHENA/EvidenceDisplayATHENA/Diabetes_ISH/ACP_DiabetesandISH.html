                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">The treatment of hypertension in patients 
                      with diabetes mellitus should decrease the rate of vascular 
                      complications with minimal side effects. In a previous cohort 
                      study (1), the use of thiazide diuretics in patients with 
                      insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and hypertension 
                      was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality when 
                      compared with a group of patients with IDDM and untreated 
                      hypertension. This has led to a recommendation for the use 
                      of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and &beta;-blockers 
                      as the first line of treatment for hypertension in diabetes 
                      and avoidance of thiazide diuretics. The deleterious effect 
                      of thiazides was thought to be caused by hypokalemia, worsening 
                      dyslipidemia, increased insulin resistance, or unknown mechanisms.</p>
                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">The analysis from the SHEP trial did not 
                      find an increased rate of cardiovascular complications; 
                      on the contrary, it found a decrease that was more marked 
                      in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic, hypertensive patients. 
                      The first and most important difference between the 2 studies 
                      is that, in the SHEP trial, low-dose chlorthalidone was 
                      used. The antihypertensive effect of this agent at lower 
                      doses is similar to that at higher doses but the rate of 
                      side effects is lower. Other important differences between 
                      the previous study and the SHEP study are that the latter 
                      included only older patients with isolated systolic hypertension 
                      and excluded patients who required insulin.</p>
                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">Although cardiovascular events were decreased 
                      in the SHEP study, the diabetic patients treated with chlorthalidone 
                      had a higher frequency of sexual dysfunction (in men), hyperglycemia, 
                      hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyponatremia than the diabetic 
                      patients who received placebo. </p>
                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">This study shows that thiazide diuretics 
                      should be considered a viable antihy-pertensive therapy 
                      in diabetic patients. They should ideally be used, however, 
                      in low doses similar to those used in this study&mdash;12.5 
                      to 25 mg/d.</p>
