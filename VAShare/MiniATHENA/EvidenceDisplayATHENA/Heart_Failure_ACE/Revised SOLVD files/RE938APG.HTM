<P CLASS="AbsHd">Objective</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">To determine whether enalapril can reduce mortality, incidence of heart failure, and rate of related hospitalizations in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Design</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with mean follow-up of 37 months, part of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Setting</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">83 hospitals in North America and Belgium from July 1986 through August 1991.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Patients</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Adults with heart disease and ejection fractions &le; 0.35 but not taking diuretics, digoxin, or vasodilators for heart failure. They could take diuretics for hypertension, digoxin for atrial fibrillation, or nitrates for angina. Patients were excluded if they had overt heart failure at the end of a 3-week run-in period (enalapril for 1 wk, placebo for 2 wk). 4228 patients were randomized (mean age<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE>, 59 y; 89% men;</STRIKE></FONT><FONT COLOR=GREEN><U> 59 y, 89% men,</U></FONT> 86% white); 7 were lost to follow-up.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Intervention</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">2111 patients were randomized to enalapril, initially 2.5 mg twice a day and increased to 10 mg twice a day if no side effects developed. 2118 patients were assigned to placebo. Patients were seen at 2 and 6 weeks, 4 months, and then every 4 months.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main outcome measures</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure (by clinical findings, need for drug treatment or hospitalization, or causing death), hospitalization, and side effects.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main results</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">The mean dose of enalapril at study end was 12.7 mg/d. Patients in the enalapril group were less likely to develop heart failure<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE> (438 vs. 640 patients; 95% CI for the 37% relative risk reduction, 28% to 44%; number needed to treat, 11)</STRIKE></FONT> and had<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE> 34% fewer total hospitalizations and 20%</STRIKE></FONT> fewer hospitalizations <FONT COLOR=GREEN><U>for heart failure or </U></FONT>for cardiovascular reasons (<I>P</I> &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons)<FONT COLOR=GREEN><U> (Table)</U></FONT>. Although other trends favored enalapril, the groups did not differ for the inter-related outcomes of total mortality (313 enalapril vs<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE>.</STRIKE></FONT> 334 placebo patients), cardiovascular death (265 vs<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE>.</STRIKE></FONT> 298), death from progressive heart failure (85 vs<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE>.</STRIKE></FONT> 106), or death from arrhythmia (98 vs<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE>.</STRIKE></FONT> 105). Possible adverse effects were similar (76% in the enalapril group vs<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE>.</STRIKE></FONT> 72% in the placebo group).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Conclusions</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Enalapril reduced the 3-year incidence of heart failure and related hospitalization in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. A trend toward reduced mortality on enalapril was not statistically significant.</p>

<P CLASS="CmTxt"><I>See also</I> <B>Captopril for left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction reduced mortality and morbidity</B> <I>and</I> <B>Enalapril for myocardial infarction did not improve 6-month mortality</B></p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">The 3 trials by the SAVE, SOLVD, and CONSENSUS II investigators add substantial new information to the continuing saga of ACE inhibitors and congestive heart failure. Previous trials in a broad spectrum of patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction documented both improved symptoms and survival with these agents (1-4). Now, for the first time, the benefit of long-term ACE inhibitors in patients with decreased ejection fractions but without overtly symptomatic heart failure has been shown.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">Specifically, the SAVE investigation by Pfeffer and colleagues showed that captopril, given to patients within days of having an acute myocardial infarction, prevented the development of both symptoms of and hospitalizations for heart failure. Moreover, active treatment reduced cardiovascular and total mortality.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">The SOLVD study by Yusuf and colleagues showed that enalapril, given to a broader range of patients with low ejection fractions from various causes but without overt heart failure, showed a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival and prevented hospitalization and slow<FONT COLOR=GREEN><U>ed</U></FONT> progression to symptomatic heart failure.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">Finally, the CONSENSUS II trial by Swedberg and colleagues showed that enalapril, given to patients within 24 hours of myocardial infarction, not only failed to produce a significant survival benefit but may possibly have increased mortality.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">The seemingly disparate findings of the 2 studies among patients with myocardial infarction (SAVE and CONSENSUS II) may be the result of several factors. In the latter trial, patients were given intravenous enalaprilat within hours of their infarctions; in the former, patients were started on oral captopril 3 to 16 days after infarction. Although it is possible that ACE inhibitors given immediately after infarction have adverse physiologic effects, other points are worth considering. The CONSENSUS II trial had an average follow-up of only 6 months; however, the positive SAVE trial followed patients for at least 2 years and did not find significant survival improvements until approximately 1 year after randomization. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, a prerequisite for admission to the positive SAVE trial, was not an entry criterion in the negative CONSENSUS II trial. As a result, some of the patients in the latter study may have had normal systolic function and thus may have been at comparatively lower risk for progression to overt and fatal heart failure. Finally, the wide confidence intervals of the treatment effect in the CONSENSUS II trial do not preclude the possibility of benefit.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">Both long-term studies of patients with decreased ejection fractions (SAVE and SOLVD) showed that ACE inhibitors reduced the incidence of symptomatic heart failure; however, the larger study (SOLVD) showed no statistically significant survival benefit. The estimate of the treatment effect in the latter trial showed a trend toward improved survival and may have been reduced by contamination; by the end of the trial, 41% of patients in the placebo group who developed symptomatic heart failure had been placed on open-label ACE inhibitors. Also, the SOLVD trial evaluated enalapril in patients with different causes of heart failure, including some with hypertensive and idiopathic cardiomyopathy, whereas the SAVE trial was confined to postinfarction patients, many of whom were already receiving digitalis, diuretic therapy, or both. Although not clearly elucidated, it is also possible that differences in co-interventions affected survival estimates in patients with decreased ejection fractions.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">Summarizing the findings from the 3 studies, clinicians should heed the following messages:</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">1. Currently, ACE inhibitors should not be used immediately after myocardial infarction (although additional ongoing studies may establish benefit or identify subsets of responsive patients or effective doses of ACE inhibitors in this setting).</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">2. ACE inhibitors in moderate to high doses should be tried in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are recovering from a myocardial infarction. Large, clinically important reductions in morbidity and mortality can be expected, as evidenced by the small number of patients (<I>n</I> = 20) needed to treat to show benefit.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">3. Finally, ACE inhibitors are reasonable agents to offer patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction regardless of cause (future studies may delineate causes that do and do not respond to ACE inhibitor therapy).</p>
