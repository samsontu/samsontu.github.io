    Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are generally prescribed by 
    physicians in doses lower than the large doses that have been shown to reduce 
    morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. It is unclear, however, 
    if low doses and high doses of ACE inhibitors have similar benefits. METHODS 
    AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 3164 patients with New York Heart Association 
    class II to IV heart failure and an ejection fraction &lt; or = 30% to double-blind 
    treatment with either low doses (2.5 to 5.0 mg daily, n=1596) or high doses 
    (32.5 to 35 mg daily, n=1568) of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, for 39 to 
    58 months, while background therapy for heart failure was continued. When 
    compared with the low-dose group, patients in the high-dose group had a nonsignificant 
    8% lower risk of death (P=0.128) but a significant 12% lower risk of death 
    or hospitalization for any reason (P=0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalizations 
    for heart failure (P=0.002). Dizziness and renal insufficiency was observed 
    more frequently in the high-dose group, but the 2 groups were similar in the 
    number of patients requiring discontinuation of the study medication. Conclusions-These 
    findings indicate that patients with heart failure should not generally be 
    maintained on very low doses of an ACE inhibitor (unless these are the only 
    doses that can be tolerated) and suggest that the difference in efficacy between 
    intermediate and high doses of an ACE inhibitor (if any) is likely to be very 
    small. [<a href="../ACP/Indiv_Packer1999.html" target="_blank">See ACP Summary</a>]

  We undertook a prospective systematic overview based on data from individual 
  patients from five long-term randomised trials that assessed inhibitors of angiotensin-converting 
  enzyme (ACE) in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. 
  METHODS: Three of the trials enrolled patients within a week after acute myocardial 
  infarction. Data were combined by use of the Peto-Yusuf method. FINDINGS: Overall 
  12,763 patients were randomly assigned treatment or placebo and followed up 
  for an average of 35 months. In the three post-infarction trials (n=5,966), 
  mortality was lower with ACE inhibitors than with placebo (702/2995 [23.4%] 
  vs 866/2971 [29.1%]; odds ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.66-0-83]), as were the rates 
  of readmission for heart failure (355 [11.9%] vs 460 [15.5%]; 0.73 [0.63-0.85]), 
  reinfarction (324 [10.8%] vs 391 [13.2%]; 0.80 [0.69-0.94]), or the composite 
  of these events (1049 [35.0%] vs 1244 [41.9%]; 0.75 [0.67-0.83]; all p&lt;O.001). 
  For all five trials the ACE inhibitor group had lower rates of death than the 
  placebo group (1,467/6,391 [23.0%] vs 1,710/6,372 [26.8%]; 0.80 [0.74-0.87]) 
  and lower rates of reinfarction (571 [8.9%] vs 703 [11.0%]; 0.79 [0.70-0.89]), 
  readmission for heart failure (876 [13.7%] vs 1202 [18.9%]; 0.67 [0.61-0.74]), 
  and the composite of these events (2161 [33.8%] vs 2610 [41.0%]; 0.72 [0.67-0.78]; 
  all p&lt;0.0001). The benefits were observed early after the start of therapy 
  and persisted long term. The benefits of treatment on all outcomes were independent 
  of age, sex, and baseline use of diuretics, aspirin, and beta-blockers. Although 
  there was a trend towards greater reduction in risk of death or readmission 
  for heart failure in patients with lower ejection fractions, benefit was apparent 
  over the range examined. </font></p>

  evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on mortality 
  and morbidity in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. DATA SOURCE 
  AND STUDY SELECTION--Data were obtained for all completed, published or unpublished, 
  randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors that were at least 8 
  weeks in duration and had determined total mortality by intention to treat, 
  regardless of sample size. Trials were identified based on literature review 
  and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical firms. DATA EXTRACTION--Using 
  standard tables, data were extracted by one author and confirmed where necessary 
  by the other author or the principal investigator of the trial. Unpublished 
  data were obtained by direct correspondence with the principal investigator 
  of each study or pharmaceutical firm. DATA SYNTHESIS--The data for each outcome 
  were combined using the Yusuf-Peto adaptation of the Mantel-Haenszel method. 
  Overall, there was a statistically significant reduction in total mortality 
  (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.88; P &lt; .001) 
  and in the combined endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for congestive 
  heart failure (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.74; P &lt; .001). Similar benefits 
  were observed with several different ACE inhibitors, although the data were 
  largely based on enalapril maleate, captopril, ramipril, quinapril hydrochloride, 
  and lisinopril. Reductions for total mortality and the combined endpoint were 
  similar for various subgroups examined (age, sex, etiology, and New York Heart 
  Association class). However, patients with the lowest ejection fraction appeared 
  to have the greatest benefit. The greatest effect was seen during the first 
  3 months, but additional benefit was observed during further treatment. The 
  reduction in mortality was primarily due to fewer deaths from progressive heart 
  failure (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83); point estimates for effects on sudden 
  or presumed arrhythmic deaths (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.12) and fatal myocardial 
  infarction (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.11) were less than 1 but were not significant. 
  CONCLUSIONS--Total mortality and hospitalization for congestive heart failure 
  are significantly reduced by ACE inhibitors with consistent effects in a broad 
  range of patients. <br>

  <font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND. 
  Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also 
  hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
  inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic 
  heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients 
  receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to 
  receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 
  20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients 
  were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up 
  averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 
  percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction 
  in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). 
  Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac 
  deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive 
  heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction 
  in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There 
  was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia 
  without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening 
  heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk 
  reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less 
  than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy 
  significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients 
  with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. [<a href="../ACP/Indiv_SOLVD1992.html" target="_blank">See

  <font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
  association between raised renin levels and myocardial infarction has been reported. 
  We studied the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
  inhibitor, on the development of myocardial infarction and unstable angina in 
  6797 patients with ejection fractions &lt; or = 0.35 enrolled into the two Studies 
  of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trials. Patients were randomly assigned 
  to placebo (n = 3401) or enalapril (n = 3396) at doses of 2.5-20 mg per day 
  in two concurrent double-blind trials with the same protocol. Patients with 
  heart failure entered the treatment trial (n = 2569) and those without heart 
  failure entered the prevention trial (n = 4228). Follow-up averaged 40 months. 
  In each trial there were significant reductions in the number of patients developing 
  myocardial infarction (treatment trial: 158 placebo vs 127 enalapril, p &lt; 
  0.02; prevention trial: 204 vs 161 p &lt; 0.01) or unstable angina (240 vs 187 
  p &lt; 0.001; 355 vs 312, p &lt; 0.05). Combined, there were 362 placebo group 
  patients with myocardial infarction compared with 288 in the enalapril group 
  (risk reduction 23%, 95% CI 11-34%; p &lt; 0.001). 595 placebo group patients 
  developed unstable angina compared with 499 in the enalapril group (risk reduction 
  20%, 95% CI 9-29%, p &lt; 0.001). There was also a reduction in cardiac deaths 
  (711 placebo, 615 enalapril; p &lt; 0.003), so that the reduction in the combined 
  endpoint of deaths, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina was highly significant 
  (20% risk reduction, 95% CI 14-26%; p &lt; 0.0001). Enalapril treatment significantly 
  reduced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiac mortality in patients 
  with low ejection fractions. </font></p>
