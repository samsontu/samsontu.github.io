                    To review the scientific evidence concerning the safety and 
                    efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line 
                    agents and evaluated in terms of major disease end points. 
                    DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE searches and previous meta-analyses 
                    for 1980 to 1995. DATA SELECTION: We selected long-term studies 
                    that assessed major disease end points as an outcome. For 
                    the meta-analysis, we chose placebo-controlled randomized 
                    trials. For randomized trials using surrogate end points such 
                    as blood pressure, we selected the largest studies that evaluated 
                    multiple drugs. Where clinical trial evidence was lacking, 
                    we relied on information from observational studies. DATA 
                    SYNTHESIS: Diuretics and beta-blockers have been evaluated 
                    in 18 long-term randomized trials. Compared with placebo, 
                    beta-blocker therapy was effective in preventing stroke (relative 
                    risk [RR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.86) 
                    and congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.84). 
                    The findings were similar for high-dose diuretic therapy (for 
                    stroke, RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62; and for congestive heart 
                    failure, RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.41). Low-dose diuretic therapy 
                    prevented not only stroke (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.78) and 
                    congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.76) but 
                    also coronary disease (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85) and total 
                    mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99). Although calcium 
                    channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
                    reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, the clinical 
                    trial evidence in terms of health outcomes is meager. For 
                    several short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, 
                    the available evidence suggests the possibility of harm. Whether 
                    the long-acting formulations and the nondihydropyridine calcium 
                    channel blockers are safe and prevent major cardiovascular 
                    events in patients with hypertension remains untested and 
                    therefore unknown. CONCLUSION: Until the results of large 
                    long-term clinical trials evaluating the effects of calcium 
                    channel blockers and ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular disease 
                    incidence are completed, the available scientific evidence 
                    provides strong support for the current national guidelines, 
                    which recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as firstline agents 
                    and low-dose therapy for all antihypertensive agents. [<a href="#Psaty" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_Psaty1997.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See

                    The available evidence about the effectiveness of specific 
                    first-line antihypertensive drugs in lowering blood pressure 
                    and preventing adverse outcomes has not been systematically 
                    quantified in a manner that would assist clinicians in choosing 
                    a first-line drug. Methods: The following literature sources 
                    were searched: MEDLINE (1966-1997), the Cochrane Library (1998 
                    CD-ROM, issue 2) and references from previous meta-analyses 
                    published from 1980 to 1997. Selected were randomized controlled 
                    trials of at least 1 year's duration that provided morbidity 
                    or mortality data and that compared 1 of 6 possible first-line 
                    antihypertensive therapies either with another 1 of the 6 
                    drug therapies (drug-drug comparison) or with no treatment, 
                    including placebo (drug-no treatment comparison). The following 
                    outcomes were pooled according to trial design (drug-drug 
                    or drug-no treatment comparison) and the drug therapy: death, 
                    stroke, coronary artery disease, total cardiovascular events, 
                    withdrawal due to adverse effect, and decrease in systolic 
                    and diastolic blood pressure. Results: Of 38 trials identified, 
                    23 (representing 50 853 patients) met the inclusion criteria. 
                    Four drug classes were evaluated in the trials: thiazides 
                    (21 trials), &szlig;-adrenergic blockers (5), calcium-channel 
                    blockers (4) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
                    (1). In 5 drug-drug trials comparing thiazides with &szlig;-blockers, 
                    the former were associated with a significantly lower rate 
                    of withdrawal due to adverse effects (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 
                    95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.76). In the trials that 
                    had an untreated control group, low-dose thiazide therapy 
                    was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of 
                    death (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.99), stroke (RR 0.66, 95% CI 
                    0.56-0.79), coronary artery disease (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84) 
                    and cardiovascular events (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.62-0.75). High-dose 
                    thiazide therapy, &szlig;-blocker therapy and calcium-channel 
                    blocker therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of death 
                    or coronary artery disease. When the results for total cardiovascular 
                    events were expressed in terms of absolute risk reduction, 
                    low-dose thiazide therapy reduced the risk by 5.7% (95% CI 
                    4.2%-7.2%); the number needed to treat (NNT) for approximately 
                    5 years to prevent one event was 18. In both the drug-drug 
                    and the drug-no treatment comparison trials, thiazides were 
                    significantly better at reducing systolic blood pressure than 
                    the other drug classes. Interpretation: Low-dose thiazide 
                    therapy can be prescribed as the first-line treatment of hypertension 
                    with confidence that the risk of death, coronary artery disease 
                    and stroke will be reduced. The same cannot be said for high-dose 
                    thiazide therapy, &szlig;-blockers, calcium-channel blockers 
                    or ACE inhibitors. [<a href="#Wright" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_Wright1999.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See
