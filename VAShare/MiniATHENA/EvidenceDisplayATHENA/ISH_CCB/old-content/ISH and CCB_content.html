    Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15% of people aged 60 years 
    or older. In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the 
    Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular 
    complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke 
    combined was the primary endpoint. METHODS: All patients (&gt; 60 years) were 
    initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, 
    their average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic 
    blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, 
    and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned 
    to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 
    mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0 mg daily, or matching placebos. 
    Patients withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We 
    compared occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At 
    a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
    had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 
    23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group 
    differences were systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8-11.4) and diastolic, 4.5 
    mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active treatment reduced the total rate of stroke from 13.7 
    to 7.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years (42% reduction; p = 0.003). Non-fatal 
    stroke decreased by 44% (p = 0.007). In the active treatment group, all fatal 
    and non-fatal cardiac endpoints, including sudden death, declined by 26% (p 
    = 0.03). Non-fatal cardiac endpoints decreased by 33% (p = 0.03) and all fatal 
    and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints by 31% (p &lt; 0.001). Cardiovascular 
    mortality was slightly lower on active treatment (-27%, p = 0.07), but all-cause 
    mortality was not influenced (-14%; p = 0.22). INTERPRETATION: Among elderly 
    patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment 
    starting with nitrendipine reduces the rate of cardiovascular complications. 
    Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years with this type of regimen may prevent 
    29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular endpoints.</font></p>

    <font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND: 
    Previous meta-analysis of outcome trials in hypertension have not specifically 
    focused on isolated systolic hypertension or they have explained treatment 
    benefit mainly in function of the achieved diastolic blood pressure reduction. 
    We therefore undertook a quantitative overview of the trials to further evaluate 
    the risks associated with systolic blood pressure in treated and untreated 
    older patients with isolated systolic hypertension METHODS: Patients were 
    60 years old or more. Systolic blood pressure was 160 mm Hg or greater and 
    diastolic blood pressure was less than 95 mm Hg. We used non-parametric methods 
    and Cox regression to model the risks associated with blood pressure and to 
    correct for regression dilution bias. We calculated pooled effects of treatment 
    from stratified 2 x 2 contingency tables after application of Zelen's test 
    of heterogeneity. FINDINGS: In eight trials 15 693 patients with isolated 
    systolic hypertension were followed up for 3.8 years (median). After correction 
    for regression dilution bias, sex, age, and diastolic blood pressure, the 
    relative hazard rates associated with a 10 mm Hg higher initial systolic blood 
    pressure were 1.26 (p=0.0001) for total mortality, 1.22 (p=0.02) for stroke, 
    but only 1.07 (p=0.37) for coronary events. Independent of systolic blood 
    pressure, diastolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with total mortality, 
    highlighting the role of pulse pressure as risk factor. Active treatment reduced 
    total mortality by 13% (95% CI 2-22, p=0.02), cardiovascular mortality by 
    18%, all cardiovascular complications by 26%, stroke by 30%, and coronary 
    events by 23%. The number of patients to treat for 5 years to prevent one 
    major cardiovascular event was lower in men (18 vs 38), at or above age 70 
    (19 vs 39), and in patients with previous cardiovascular complications (16 
    vs 37). INTERPRETATION: Drug treatment is justified in older patients with 
    isolated systolic hypertension whose systolic blood pressure is 160 mm Hg 
    or higher. Absolute benefit is larger in men, in patients aged 70 or more 
    and in those with previous cardiovascular complications or wider pulse pressure. 
    Treatment prevented stroke more effectively than coronary events. However, 
    the absence of a relation between coronary events and systolic blood pressure 
    in untreated patients suggests that the coronary protection may have been 
    underestimated. [<a href="file:///E|/VA/Tabs/ACP/Indiv_Staessen2000.html" target="_blank">See
