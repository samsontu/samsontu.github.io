                    Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15% of people 
                    aged 60 years or older. In 1989, the European Working Party 
                    on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether 
                    active treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications 
                    of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke 
                    combined was the primary endpoint. METHODS: All patients (&gt; 
                    60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three 
                    run-in visits 1 month apart, their average sitting systolic 
                    blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure 
                    lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, 
                    and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were 
                    randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the 
                    possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 
                    12.5-25.0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing 
                    from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared 
                    occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 
                    At a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic 
                    blood pressures had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the 
                    placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the 
                    active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group differences 
                    were systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8-11.4) and diastolic, 
                    4.5 mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active treatment reduced the total rate 
                    of stroke from 13.7 to 7.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years 
                    (42% reduction; p = 0.003). Non-fatal stroke decreased by 
                    44% (p = 0.007). In the active treatment group, all fatal 
                    and non-fatal cardiac endpoints, including sudden death, declined 
                    by 26% (p = 0.03). Non-fatal cardiac endpoints decreased by 
                    33% (p = 0.03) and all fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular 
                    endpoints by 31% (p &lt; 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality 
                    was slightly lower on active treatment (-27%, p = 0.07), but 
                    all-cause mortality was not influenced (-14%; p = 0.22). INTERPRETATION: 
                    Among elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, 
                    antihypertensive drug treatment starting with nitrendipine 
                    reduces the rate of cardiovascular complications. Treatment 
                    of 1000 patients for 5 years with this type of regimen may 
                    prevent 29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular endpoints.<br>

                    <font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND: 
                    Previous meta-analysis of outcome trials in hypertension have 
                    not specifically focused on isolated systolic hypertension 
                    or they have explained treatment benefit mainly in function 
                    of the achieved diastolic blood pressure reduction. We therefore 
                    undertook a quantitative overview of the trials to further 
                    evaluate the risks associated with systolic blood pressure 
                    in treated and untreated older patients with isolated systolic 
                    hypertension METHODS: Patients were 60 years old or more. 
                    Systolic blood pressure was 160 mm Hg or greater and diastolic 
                    blood pressure was less than 95 mm Hg. We used non-parametric 
                    methods and Cox regression to model the risks associated with 
                    blood pressure and to correct for regression dilution bias. 
                    We calculated pooled effects of treatment from stratified 
                    2 x 2 contingency tables after application of Zelen's test 
                    of heterogeneity. FINDINGS: In eight trials 15 693 patients 
                    with isolated systolic hypertension were followed up for 3.8 
                    years (median). After correction for regression dilution bias, 
                    sex, age, and diastolic blood pressure, the relative hazard 
                    rates associated with a 10 mm Hg higher initial systolic blood 
                    pressure were 1.26 (p=0.0001) for total mortality, 1.22 (p=0.02) 
                    for stroke, but only 1.07 (p=0.37) for coronary events. Independent 
                    of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure was inversely 
                    correlated with total mortality, highlighting the role of 
                    pulse pressure as risk factor. Active treatment reduced total 
                    mortality by 13% (95% CI 2-22, p=0.02), cardiovascular mortality 
                    by 18%, all cardiovascular complications by 26%, stroke by 
                    30%, and coronary events by 23%. The number of patients to 
                    treat for 5 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event 
                    was lower in men (18 vs 38), at or above age 70 (19 vs 39), 
                    and in patients with previous cardiovascular complications 
                    (16 vs 37). INTERPRETATION: Drug treatment is justified in 
                    older patients with isolated systolic hypertension whose systolic 
                    blood pressure is 160 mm Hg or higher. Absolute benefit is 
                    larger in men, in patients aged 70 or more and in those with 
                    previous cardiovascular complications or wider pulse pressure. 
                    Treatment prevented stroke more effectively than coronary 
                    events. However, the absence of a relation between coronary 
                    events and systolic blood pressure in untreated patients suggests 
                    that the coronary protection may have been underestimated.
