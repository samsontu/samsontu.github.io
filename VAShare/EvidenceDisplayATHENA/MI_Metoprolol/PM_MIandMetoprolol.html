                OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of beta blockers in short 
                term treatment for acute myocardial infarction and in longer term 
                secondary prevention; to examine predictive factors that may influence 
                outcome and therefore choice of drug; and to examine the clinical 
                importance of the results in the light of current treatment. DESIGN: 
                Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. SETTING: Randomised 
                controlled trials. SUBJECTS: Patients with acute or past myocardial 
                infarction. Intervention: beta Blockers compared with control. 
                MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality and non-fatal reinfarction. 
                RESULTS: Overall, 5477 of 54 234 patients (10.1%) randomised to 
                beta blockers or control died. We identified a 23% reduction in 
                the odds of death in long term trials (95% confidence interval 
                15% to 31%), but only a 4% reduction in the odds of death in short 
                term trials (-8% to 15%). Meta regression in long term trials 
                did not identify a significant reduction in effectiveness in drugs 
                with cardioselectivity but did identify a near significant trend 
                towards decreased benefit in drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic 
                activity. Most evidence is available for propranolol, timolol, 
                and metoprolol. In long term trials, the number needed to treat 
                for 2 years to avoid a death is 42, which compares favourably 
                with other treatments for patients with acute or past myocardial 
                infarction. CONCLUSIONS: beta Blockers are effective in long term 
                secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, but they are 
                underused in such cases and lead to avoidable mortality and morbidity.

                beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) was a National Heart, Lung, 
                and Blood Institute-sponsored, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
                and placebo-controlled trial designed to test whether the regular 
                administration of propranolol hydrochloride to men and women who 
                had experienced at least one myocardial infarction would result 
                in a significant reduction in total mortality during a two- to 
                four-year period. During a 27-month interval, 3,837 persons between 
                the ages of 30 and 69 years were randomized to either propranolol 
                (1,916 persons) or placebo (1,912 persons), five to 21 days after 
                the infarction. Depending on serum drug levels, the prescribed 
                maintenance dose of propranolol hydrochloride was either 180 or 
                240 mg/day. The trial was stopped nine months ahead of schedule. 
                Total mortality during the average 24-month follow-up period was 
                7.2% in the propranolol group and 9.8% in the placebo group. Arteriosclerotic 
                heart disease (ASHD) mortality was 6.2% in the propranolol group 
                and 8.5% in the placebo group. Sudden cardiac death, a subset 
                of ASHD mortality, was 3.3% among the propranolol patients and 
                4.6% among the placebo patients. Serious side effects were uncommon. 
                Hypotension, gastrointestinal problems, tiredness, bronchospasm, 
                and cold hands and feet occurred more frequently in the propranolol 
                group. Based on the BHAT results, the use of propranolol in patients 
                with no contraindications to beta-blockade who have had a recent 
                myocardial infarction is recommended for at least three years.<br>

                et Prevention Secondaire de l'Infarctus (APSI), a randomized, 
                placebo-controlled trial, was designed to test long-term acebutolol, 
                200 mg twice daily, a beta blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic 
                activity, in the prevention of late death in high-risk postacute 
                myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. APSI was planned because 
                patients with a death rate greater than 20% have not been enrolled 
                in significant numbers in previous trials and in such high-risk 
                patients, it remained to be proven that beta blockers have a beneficial 
                effect. Patients with an expected average risk of greater than 
                20% were to be selected based on clinical criteria. At the time 
                of the second interim analysis, the placebo group 1-year mortality 
                was much lower than expected (12%). The ethical board recommended 
                to stop the trial: 309 patients had been allocated to placebo, 
                298 to acebutolol. The average delay between onset of symptoms 
                and inclusion was 10.5 days. The average follow-up was 318 days 
                after inclusion. About the same number of patients were discontinued 
                from study treatment in both groups. All patients were included 
                in the analysis. There were 17 deaths in the acebutolol group 
                and 34 in the placebo group, a 48% decrease (p = 0.019). The vascular 
                mortality decreased by 58% (p = 0.006), the highest ever observed 
                with a beta blocker. All cardiovascular causes of death, including 
                congestive heart failure, were less frequent in the acebutolol 
                group. Although the objective was not achieved, APSI patients 
                were at a higher risk than the average of the 9 previous trials 
                with beta blockers (12% instead of 7%). In addition, the total 
                mortality reduction did not decrease in 9 subgroups with increasing 
                mortality risk from 2 to 23%. APSI shows that moderately severe 
                postAMI patients can benefit from a beta-blocking treatment and 
                a beta-blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can 
                be effective.<br>

                mid-1981 and Jan 1, 1985, 16 027 patients entering 245 coronary 
                care units at a mean of 5.0 h after the onset of suspected acute 
                myocardial infarction were randomised either to a control group 
                or to a group receiving atenolol (5-10 mg iv immediately, followed 
                by 100 mg/day orally for 7 days). Vascular mortality during the 
                treatment period (days 0-7) was significantly lower (2p less than 
                0.4) in the treated group, 313/8037 (3.89%) versus 365/7990 (4.57%), 
                but this 15% difference has wide 95% confidence limits (from about 
                zero to about a quarter). No subgroups were identified in which 
                the proportional difference in days 0-7 was clearly better, or 
                clearly worse, than 15%. After the treatment period, there was 
                only a slight further divergence (691 vs 703 additional vascular 
                deaths by Jan 1, 1985). Thus, overall vascular mortality was significantly 
                lower in the atenolol group at one year (life-table estimates: 
                10.7% atenolol vs 12.0% control; 2p less than 0.01) but not at 
                Jan 1, 1985 (crude percentages: 12.5% vs 13.4%; 2p less than 0.07). 
                However, atenolol patients were more likely than controls to be 
                discharged on beta-blockers, which can account for much of the 
                additional difference in vascular mortality after day 7. Immediate 
                beta-blockade increased the extent of inotropic drug use (5.0% 
                vs 3.4%, 2p less than 0.0001), chiefly on days 0-1, but despite 
                this most of the improvement in vascular mortality was seen during 
                days 0-1 (121 vs 171 deaths). Treatment did not appear to decrease 
                the number in whom cardiac enzymes rose to above twice the local 
                upper limit of normal. Slightly fewer non-fatal cardiac arrests 
                (189 vs 198) and reinfarctions (148 vs 161) were recorded in the 
                atenolol group, neither difference being significant. Systematic 
                review of fatal and of non-fatal events in ISIS-1 and in all other 
                randomised trials of iv beta-blockade reinforces the suggestion 
                that treatment reduces mortality in the first week by about 15%, 
                but with a rather less extreme effect in days 0-1 than was observed 
                in ISIS-1 alone. It also provides highly significant (2p less 
                than 0.0002) evidence of an effect on the combined end-point of 
                death, arrest, or reinfarction, suggesting that treatment of about 
                200 patients would lead to the avoidance of 1 reinfarction, 1 
                arrest, and 1 death during days 0-7. ISIS-1 suggests these early 
                gains will persist.<br>

                patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen 
                activator (rt-PA) and were randomized to either a conservative 
                or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects of immediate 
                versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients 
                eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of 
                which 720 were randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 
                714 to the deferred group. In the immediate intravenous group, 
                within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol was given (5 mg 
                intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total 
                intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours 
                in the first 24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). 
                The patients assigned to the deferred group received metoprolol, 
                50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed by 100 mg orally twice a 
                day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both groups 
                and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at 
                hospital discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical 
                in the two groups. The regional ventricular function was also 
                similar in the two groups. Overall, there was no difference in 
                mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred groups, 
                but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 
                6 weeks among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in 
                contrast to seven deaths among those in whom beta-blocker therapy 
                was deferred. These findings for a secondary end point in a subgroup 
                were not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation regarding 
                clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction (2.7% 
                versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 
                24.1%, p less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous 
                group. Thus, in appropriate postinfarction patients, beta-blockers 
                are safe when given early after thrombolytic therapy and are associated 
                with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction in the first 
                week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving 
                ventricular function or reducing mortality.<br>

                beta blockers given early in acute myocardial infarction have 
                been shown to reduce chest pain, enzyme release and incidence 
                of arrhythmias. Data published before the first report of the 
                ISIS-1 group (International Studies of Infarct Survival) showed 
                a 12% decrease in the probability of death using intravenous beta 
                blockade but with large confidence limits. This study assessed 
                and compared the effects of early intravenous atenolol and control 
                treatment in the first week and first year after acute myocardial 
                infarction in 16,027 patients. The principal endpoint was vascular 
                death; most of the 15% decrease in mortality occurred in the first 
                24 to 36 hours with a significant difference at 1 week (313 vs 
                365 deaths in the atenolol and control groups, respectively). 
                There was no rebound effect after stopping treatment after 7 days. 
                Mortality at 1 year also showed a significant difference in favor 
                of the atenolol group. Subgroup analysis found no significant 
                difference in mortality by age, sex, initial heart rate, diabetes 
                or entry electrocardiogram but data-derived analysis revealed 
                a highly significant decrease in mortality if treatment began 
                within 2 hours of the onset of pain. There was a significant 1% 
                to 2% excess in inotrope use in the atenolol group in the first 
                36 hours, and first-degree heart block and bundle branch block 
                emerged as relative contraindications to this treatment. The results 
                suggest that early intravenous beta blockade in acute myocardial 
                infarction is safe and effective and also cost effective in comparison 
                with postdischarge oral beta blockade therapy.<br>

                OBJECTIVE--To investigate the effects of prophylactic therapy 
                with antiarrhythmic agents on mortality in patients with myocardial 
                infarction. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION--Data were obtained 
                from all completed, published or unpublished, randomized, parallel 
                controlled trials of antiarrhythmic agents, regardless of sample 
                size. Investigators were contacted for data on patients excluded 
                after randomization. DATA EXTRACTION--Data on mortality were extracted 
                by one author and confirmed where necessary by the others. DATA 
                SYNTHESIS--Mortality data from 138 trials on 98,000 patients were 
                combined by the Yusuf-Peto adaptation of the Mantel-Haenszel method. 
                There were 660 deaths among 11,712 patients allocated to receive 
                class I agents and 571 deaths among 11,517 corresponding control 
                patients (51 trials: odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval 
                [CI], 1.01 to 1.28; P = .03). Of 26,973 patients allocated to 
                receive beta-blockers (class II agents), 1464 died compared with 
                1727 deaths among 26,295 control patients (55 trials: OR, 0.81; 
                95% CI, 0.75 to 0.87; P = .00001). Of 778 patients allocated to 
                receive amiodarone (a class III agent), 77 died compared with 
                101 deaths in 779 control patients (eight trials: OR, 0.71; 95% 
                CI, 0.51 to 0.97; P = .03). There were 982 deaths in 10,154 patients 
                allocated to receive a class IV agent (calcium channel blockers) 
                and 949 deaths in 10,188 control patients (24 trials: OR, 1.04; 
                95% CI, 0.95 to 1.14; P = .41). CONCLUSIONS--The routine use of 
                class I antiarrhythmic agents after myocardial infarction is associated 
                with increased mortality. beta-Blockers have been conclusively 
                demonstrated to reduce mortality. The limited data on amiodarone 
                appear promising. Data on calcium channel blockers remain unpromising.

                objective of the Beta-Blocker Pooling Project (BBPP) was to collect 
                and analyse data from the major long-term secondary prevention 
                trials in order to determine whether there are subsets of post-infarction 
                patients who benefit to a greater or lesser extent from beta-blocker 
                therapy than the average patient population. One-year all-cause 
                mortality data from nine trials involving 13,679 patients were 
                obtained. Overall, mortality was 24% lower in the beta-blocker 
                group compared to the placebo group. However, there was heterogeneity 
                among the results of the trials, which tested seven different 
                beta-blockers. Subgroups with high placebo group mortality (e.g. 
                patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction (MI), 
                angina pectoris, mechanical or electrical complications, and digitalis 
                usage) seemed to benefit particularly from beta-blocker treatment. 
                These findings were consistent in the nine trials. Patients in 
                the lower risk subgroups also appeared to benefit from beta-blockers, 
                but this benefit was smaller in absolute terms and inconsistent 
                across the trials. There was no evidence that treatment outcome 
                was related to gender, baseline level of heart rate or blood pressure, 
                or time of initiation of treatment after hospital admission. In 
                conclusion, the Pooling Project indicates that high risk MI patients, 
                without contraindications to beta-blockers, are the prime candidates 
                for long-term therapy, but the lower risk patients may also receive 
                some benefit.<br>

                Long-term beta blockade for perhaps a year or so following discharge 
                after an MI is now of proven value, and for many such patients 
                mortality reductions of about 25% can be achieved. No important 
                differences are clearly apparent among the benefits of different 
                beta blockers, although some are more convenient than others (or 
                have slightly fewer side effects), and it appears that those with 
                appreciable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may confer less 
                benefit. If monitored, the side effects of long-term therapy are 
                not a major problem, as when they occur they are easily reversible 
                by changing the beta blocker or by discontinuation of treatment. 
                By contrast, although very early IV short-term beta blockade can 
                definitely limit infarct size, more reliable information about 
                the effects of such treatment on mortality will not be available 
                until a large trial (ISIS) reports later this year, with data 
                on some thousands of patients entered within less than 4 hours 
                of the onset of pain. Our aim has been not only to review the 
                65-odd randomized beta blocker trials but also to demonstrate 
                that when many randomized trials have all applied one general 
                approach to treatment, it is often not appropriate to base inference 
                on individual trial results. Although there will usually be important 
                differences from one trial to another (in eligibility, treatment, 
                end-point assessment, and so on), physicians who wish to decide 
                whether to adopt a particular treatment policy should try to make 
                their decision in the light of an overview of all these related 
                randomized trials and not just a few particular trial results. 
                Although most trials are too small to be individually reliable, 
                this defect of size may be rectified by an overview of many trials, 
                as long as appropriate statistical methods are used. Fortunately, 
                robust statistical methods exist--based on direct, unweighted 
                summation of one O-E value from each trial--that are simple for 
                physicians to use and understand yet provide full statistical 
                sensitivity. These methods allow combination of information from 
                different trials while avoiding the unjustified direct comparison 
                of patients in one trial with patients in another. (Moreover, 
                they can be extended of such data that there is no real need for 
                the introduction of any more complex statistical methods that 
                might be more difficult for physicians to trust.) Their robustness, 
                sensitivity, and avoidance of unnecessary complexity make these 
                particular methods an important tool in trial overviews.<br>
