                      was reduced for all &szlig;-blockers combined (OR 0.77,

                      for a reduction with long-term &szlig;-blocker use. No additional 
                      benefit was shown if the initial treatment started with 
                      an intravenous dose (OR 0.87, CI 0.61 to 1.22). Subgroup 
                      analyses did not differ in reductions in mortality over

                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">&szlig;-adrenergic receptor blockade in the 
                      acute and the convalescent phases of MI is the standard 
                      of care (1) established in a remarkable series of clinical 
                      trials. Despite the evidence, &szlig;-blockers after MI 
                      continue to be underused (2). Freemantle and colleagues, 
                      who have collated data from many &szlig;-blocker trials, 
                      have shown that, although short-term &szlig;-blocker use 
                      does not decrease mortality, long-term &szlig;-blockade 
                      trials show consistent benefit. Early intravenous &szlig;-blocker 
                      therapy in acute MI is recommended by the joint American 
                      College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines 
                      for the management of patients with acute MI (1). The present 
                      review calls into question the benefit of early intravenous 
                      use of &szlig;-blockers in acute MI. The widespread use 
                      of thrombolysis and primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty 
                      (where available) improves prognosis so markedly that any 
                      additional short-term benefit of &szlig;-blockers may be 
                      hard to prove. Clinicians faced with this question can wonder 
                      what role &szlig;-blockers have in treating acute MI. However, 
                      the clinical setting often includes an important subset 
                      of patients in whom thrombolysis either fails or results 
                      in suboptimal outcomes (3). Here, &szlig;-blockers are likely 
                      to improve mortality, attenuate ischemic pain, and prevent 
                      tachyarrhythmias. </p>
                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">Long-term use of &szlig;-blockers after MI 
                      remains unchallenged and is highlighted by the present review. 
                      After an MI, patients often develop further clinical and 
                      subclinical myocardial damage, which can increase the chance 
                      of arrhythmias by altering the heart muscle with more scar 
                      tissue. Therefore, &szlig;-blockers should probably be used 
                      indefinitely. Should the &szlig;-blockers used be those 
                      with selective, nonselective, or intrinsic sympathomimetic 
                      activity? This meta-analysis raises interesting but unanswered 
                      questions about their relative clinical efficiency. It also 
                      seems prudent to use the actual agents that have shown benefit 
                      at established doses. The low withdrawal rates with &szlig;-blockers 
                      emphasize the tolerability of the therapy.</p>
