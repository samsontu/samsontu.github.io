<P CLASS="AbsHd">Objective</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">In patients with myocardial infarction (MI), do &szlig;-blockers 
  reduce all-cause mortality and recurrent MI without adverse effects?</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Data sources</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Studies were identified by searching databases from their inception 
  to 1997 (MEDLINE, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, Biosis, Sigle, HealthStar, IHTA, Conference 
  Papers Index, Derwent Drug File, Dissertation Abstracts, International Pharmaceutical 
  Abstracts, Pascal, and Science Citation Index). Bibliographies of relevant studies 
  and reviews were also checked. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Study selection</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Randomized controlled trials were selected if treatment lasted 
  1 day, patients had had an MI, and &szlig;-blockers were compared with placebo 
  or other therapies. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Data extraction</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Data were extracted on patient numbers and characteristics; 
  type, route, and dose of therapies; duration of treatment and follow-up; loss 
  to follow-up; blinding; concealment of randomization; study inclusion and exclusion 
  criteria; and outcomes (deaths, recurrent MI, and withdrawals). </p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main results</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">82 trials met the inclusion criteria (54 234 patients). Short-term 
  (treatment duration &lt; 6 wk from onset of pain) studies (n = 51) had an overall 
  mortality rate of 10.5%. In these studies, &szlig;-blockers did not reduce mortality 
  (odds ratio [OR] for random-effects model 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08); subgroup 
  analyses did not differ in mortality for individual drugs.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt"> Long-term (treatment duration 6 to 48 mo) studies (n = 31) 
  had a mortality rate of 9.7%. Mortality was reduced for all &szlig;-blockers 
  combined (OR 0.77, CI 0.69 to 0.85) and also for metoprolol (OR 0.80, CI 0.66 
  to 0.96, 7 studies), propranolol (OR 0.71, CI 0.59 to 0.77, 7 studies), and 
  timolol (OR 0.59, CI 0.46 to 0.77, 2 studies). Drugs with cardioselectivity 
  showed no reduction in mortality (OR 1.10, CI 0.89 to 1.39). Drugs with intrinsic 
  sympathomimetic activity showed a trend toward increased mortality (OR 1.19, 
  CI 0.96 to 1.47). Data on reinfarction showed similar trends for a reduction 
  with long-term &szlig;-blocker use. No additional benefit was shown if the initial 
  treatment started with an intravenous dose (OR 0.87, CI 0.61 to 1.22). Subgroup 
  analyses did not differ in reductions in mortality over time. Withdrawal rates 
  ranged from 10% to 30% and were similar in the treatment and control groups. 
</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Conclusion</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Long-term treatment (6 to 48 mo) with &szlig;-blockers reduces 
  mortality in patients who have had a myocardial infarction. </p>

<P CLASS="CmHd">Commentary</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">&szlig;-adrenergic receptor blockade in the acute and the convalescent 
  phases of MI is the standard of care (1) established in a remarkable series 
  of clinical trials. Despite the evidence, &szlig;-blockers after MI continue 
  to be underused (2). Freemantle and colleagues, who have collated data from 
  many &szlig;-blocker trials, have shown that, although short-term &szlig;-blocker 
  use does not decrease mortality, long-term &szlig;-blockade trials show consistent 
  benefit. Early intravenous &szlig;-blocker therapy in acute MI is recommended 
  by the joint American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines 
  for the management of patients with acute MI (1). The present review calls into 
  question the benefit of early intravenous use of &szlig;-blockers in acute MI. 
  The widespread use of thrombolysis and primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty 
  (where available) improves prognosis so markedly that any additional short-term 
  benefit of &szlig;-blockers may be hard to prove. Clinicians faced with this 
  question can wonder what role &szlig;-blockers have in treating acute MI. However, 
  the clinical setting often includes an important subset of patients in whom 
  thrombolysis either fails or results in suboptimal outcomes (3). Here, &szlig;-blockers 
  are likely to improve mortality, attenuate ischemic pain, and prevent tachyarrhythmias. 
</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">Long-term use of &szlig;-blockers after MI remains unchallenged 
  and is highlighted by the present review. After an MI, patients often develop 
  further clinical and subclinical myocardial damage, which can increase the chance 
  of arrhythmias by altering the heart muscle with more scar tissue. Therefore, 
  &szlig;-blockers should probably be used indefinitely. Should the &szlig;-blockers 
  used be those with selective, nonselective, or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity? 
  This meta-analysis raises interesting but unanswered questions about their relative 
  clinical efficiency. It also seems prudent to use the actual agents that have 
  shown benefit at established doses. The low withdrawal rates with &szlig;-blockers 
  emphasize the tolerability of the therapy.</p>
