                      represent part of a paper that aims to answer the following 
                      question: Regarding health outcomes, which antihypertensive 
                      therapies qualify to be used as first-line agents for the 
                      treatment of hypertension? These investigators have also 
                      reviewed clinical trials in hypertension that evaluate surrogate 
                      end points (the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study, a 
                      Veterans Affairs trial, and the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic 
                      Atherosclerosis Study), clinical trials of secondary prevention 
                      (calcium channel blockers for coronary heart disease and 
                      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for congestive 
                      heart failure), and observational studies. Psaty and colleagues 
                      conclude that diuretic therapy and &beta;-blocker therapy 
                      are the only proven first-line agents for hypertension.

                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">On the basis of results from large clinical 
                      trials, the authors consider both &beta;-blocker therapy 
                      and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for patients 
                      with coronary heart disease and angiotensin-converting enzyme 
                      inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure to 
                      be &quot;special indications.&quot; It is also worth emphasizing 
                      that the effectiveness of a low-dose diuretic-based antihypertensive 
                      strategy in the elderly is indisputable: 40 to 50 patients 
                      would need to be treated with low-dose diuretics for 5 years 
                      to prevent 1 additional major cardiovascular event, and 
                      71 patients would need to be treated for 5 years to prevent 
                      1 additional death (95% CI 37 to 717). Conclusions were

                      In meta-analyses of drug-drug comparisons, no differences 
                      existed in death, stroke, CAD, or total cardiovascular events. 
                      Fewer withdrawals because of adverse effects occurred with 
                      thiazides than with &szlig;-blockers and in 1 trial with 
                      a calcium-channel blocker than with an angiotensin-converting 
                      enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Table). In comparisons of drugs 
                      with no treatment, low-dose thiazides reduced death, and 
                      thiazides (all doses) and a calcium-channel blocker reduced 
                      stroke and total cardiovascular events; only low-dose thiazides 
                      reduced CAD (<a href="#Table">Table</a>). </p>

                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">Many large studies have shown that low-dose 
                      thiazide diuretics are efficacious and efficient in treating 
                      hypertension. Several national guidelines, including the 
                      U.S. Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, 
                      and Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (1), have recommended 
                      thiazides as first-line antihypertensive therapy. Yet in 
                      practice, use of thiazides lags far behind the newer antihypertensive 
                      drugs, even though the effectiveness of these has been less 
                      well shown. </p>
                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">Unfortunately, few direct comparisons have 
                      been done among different classes of antihypertensive drugs. 
                      Those comparisons that have been done were limited to 2 
                      classes of drugs in any 1 study, usually between &szlig;-blockers 
                      and thiazides. A comparison of several classes of drugs 
                      is now under way in the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering 
                      Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study (2). 
                      It is designed to compare the mortality and cardiovascular 
                      outcomes of a relatively high-risk group of patients with 
                      hypertension treated with either a thiazide, a calcium-channel 
                      blocker, an ACE inhibitor, or an a-blocker. This large study 
                      with 42 451 patients is partially completed, and final results 
                      are expected in 2 to 3 years. </p>
                    <P CLASS="CmTxt">What should clinicians do until then? As 
                      concluded in this and other systematic reviews (using somewhat 
                      different methods), low-dose thiazides should be the first 
                      line of treatment for hypertension. Such therapy reduces 
                      not only risk for stroke but also other cardiovascular morbidity 
                      and mortality. Thiazides are inexpensive drugs with the 
                      strongest evidence for effectiveness from hypertension studies.</p>
