    </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="663333">OBJECTIVE: 
    To review the scientific evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various 
    antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms 
    of major disease end points. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE searches and previous meta-analyses 
    for 1980 to 1995. DATA SELECTION: We selected long-term studies that assessed 
    major disease end points as an outcome. For the meta-analysis, we chose placebo-controlled 
    randomized trials. For randomized trials using surrogate end points such as 
    blood pressure, we selected the largest studies that evaluated multiple drugs. 
    Where clinical trial evidence was lacking, we relied on information from observational 
    studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Diuretics and beta-blockers have been evaluated in 
    18 long-term randomized trials. Compared with placebo, beta-blocker therapy 
    was effective in preventing stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% confidence 
    interval [CI], 0.59-0.86) and congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 
    0.40-0.84). The findings were similar for high-dose diuretic therapy (for 
    stroke, RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62; and for congestive heart failure, RR, 
    0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.41). Low-dose diuretic therapy prevented not only stroke 
    (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.78) and congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% 
    CI, 0.44-0.76) but also coronary disease (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85) and 
    total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99). Although calcium channel blockers 
    and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure in 
    hypertensive patients, the clinical trial evidence in terms of health outcomes 
    is meager. For several short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, 
    the available evidence suggests the possibility of harm. Whether the long-acting 
    formulations and the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are safe 
    and prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension remains 
    untested and therefore unknown. CONCLUSION: Until the results of large long-term 
    clinical trials evaluating the effects of calcium channel blockers and ACE 
    inhibitors on cardiovascular disease incidence are completed, the available 
    scientific evidence provides strong support for the current national guidelines, 
    which recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as firstline agents and low-dose 
    therapy for all antihypertensive agents. [<a href="../ACP/Indiv_Psaty1997.html" target="_blank">See

    </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="663333">Background: 
    The available evidence about the effectiveness of specific first-line antihypertensive 
    drugs in lowering blood pressure and preventing adverse outcomes has not been 
    systematically quantified in a manner that would assist clinicians in choosing 
    a first-line drug. Methods: The following literature sources were searched: 
    MEDLINE (1966-1997), the Cochrane Library (1998 CD-ROM, issue 2) and references 
    from previous meta-analyses published from 1980 to 1997. Selected were randomized 
    controlled trials of at least 1 year's duration that provided morbidity or 
    mortality data and that compared 1 of 6 possible first-line antihypertensive 
    therapies either with another 1 of the 6 drug therapies (drug-drug comparison) 
    or with no treatment, including placebo (drug-no treatment comparison). The 
    following outcomes were pooled according to trial design (drug-drug or drug-no 
    treatment comparison) and the drug therapy: death, stroke, coronary artery 
    disease, total cardiovascular events, withdrawal due to adverse effect, and 
    decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Results: Of 38 trials identified, 
    23 (representing 50 853 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Four drug classes 
    were evaluated in the trials: thiazides (21 trials), &szlig;-adrenergic blockers 
    (5), calcium-channel blockers (4) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) 
    inhibitors (1). In 5 drug-drug trials comparing thiazides with &szlig;-blockers, 
    the former were associated with a significantly lower rate of withdrawal due 
    to adverse effects (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
    0.63-0.76). In the trials that had an untreated control group, low-dose thiazide 
    therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death (RR 
    0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.99), stroke (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.79), coronary artery 
    disease (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.68, 95% 
    CI 0.62-0.75). High-dose thiazide therapy, &szlig;-blocker therapy and calcium-channel 
    blocker therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of death or coronary 
    artery disease. When the results for total cardiovascular events were expressed 
    in terms of absolute risk reduction, low-dose thiazide therapy reduced the 
    risk by 5.7% (95% CI 4.2%-7.2%); the number needed to treat (NNT) for approximately 
    5 years to prevent one event was 18. In both the drug-drug and the drug-no 
    treatment comparison trials, thiazides were significantly better at reducing 
    systolic blood pressure than the other drug classes. Interpretation: Low-dose 
    thiazide therapy can be prescribed as the first-line treatment of hypertension 
    with confidence that the risk of death, coronary artery disease and stroke 
    will be reduced. The same cannot be said for high-dose thiazide therapy, &szlig;-blockers, 
    calcium-channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. [<a href="../ACP/Indiv_Wright1999.html" target="_blank">See
