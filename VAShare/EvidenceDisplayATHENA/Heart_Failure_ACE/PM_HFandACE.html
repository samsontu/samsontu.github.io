                    </font><font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND: 
                    Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are generally 
                    prescribed by physicians in doses lower than the large doses 
                    that have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in 
                    patients with heart failure. It is unclear, however, if low 
                    doses and high doses of ACE inhibitors have similar benefits. 
                    METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 3164 patients with 
                    New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and 
                    an ejection fraction &lt; or = 30% to double-blind treatment 
                    with either low doses (2.5 to 5.0 mg daily, n=1596) or high 
                    doses (32.5 to 35 mg daily, n=1568) of the ACE inhibitor, 
                    lisinopril, for 39 to 58 months, while background therapy 
                    for heart failure was continued. When compared with the low-dose 
                    group, patients in the high-dose group had a nonsignificant 
                    8% lower risk of death (P=0.128) but a significant 12% lower 
                    risk of death or hospitalization for any reason (P=0.002) 
                    and 24% fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (P=0.002). 
                    Dizziness and renal insufficiency was observed more frequently 
                    in the high-dose group, but the 2 groups were similar in the 
                    number of patients requiring discontinuation of the study 
                    medication. Conclusions-These findings indicate that patients 
                    with heart failure should not generally be maintained on very 
                    low doses of an ACE inhibitor (unless these are the only doses 
                    that can be tolerated) and suggest that the difference in 
                    efficacy between intermediate and high doses of an ACE inhibitor 
                    (if any) is likely to be very small. [<a href="#Packer" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_Packer1999.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See

                  We undertook a prospective systematic overview based on data 
                  from individual patients from five long-term randomised trials 
                  that assessed inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
                  in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. 
                  METHODS: Three of the trials enrolled patients within a week 
                  after acute myocardial infarction. Data were combined by use 
                  of the Peto-Yusuf method. FINDINGS: Overall 12,763 patients 
                  were randomly assigned treatment or placebo and followed up 
                  for an average of 35 months. In the three post-infarction trials 
                  (n=5,966), mortality was lower with ACE inhibitors than with 
                  placebo (702/2995 [23.4%] vs 866/2971 [29.1%]; odds ratio 0.74 
                  [95% CI 0.66-0-83]), as were the rates of readmission for heart 
                  failure (355 [11.9%] vs 460 [15.5%]; 0.73 [0.63-0.85]), reinfarction 
                  (324 [10.8%] vs 391 [13.2%]; 0.80 [0.69-0.94]), or the composite 
                  of these events (1049 [35.0%] vs 1244 [41.9%]; 0.75 [0.67-0.83]; 
                  all p&lt;O.001). For all five trials the ACE inhibitor group 
                  had lower rates of death than the placebo group (1,467/6,391 
                  [23.0%] vs 1,710/6,372 [26.8%]; 0.80 [0.74-0.87]) and lower 
                  rates of reinfarction (571 [8.9%] vs 703 [11.0%]; 0.79 [0.70-0.89]), 
                  readmission for heart failure (876 [13.7%] vs 1202 [18.9%]; 
                  0.67 [0.61-0.74]), and the composite of these events (2161 [33.8%] 
                  vs 2610 [41.0%]; 0.72 [0.67-0.78]; all p&lt;0.0001). The benefits 
                  were observed early after the start of therapy and persisted 
                  long term. The benefits of treatment on all outcomes were independent 
                  of age, sex, and baseline use of diuretics, aspirin, and beta-blockers. 
                  Although there was a trend towards greater reduction in risk 
                  of death or readmission for heart failure in patients with lower 
                  ejection fractions, benefit was apparent over the range examined.<br>

                  </font><font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OBJECTIVE--To 
                  evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
                  on mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic congestive 
                  heart failure. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION--Data were obtained 
                  for all completed, published or unpublished, randomized, placebo-controlled 
                  trials of ACE inhibitors that were at least 8 weeks in duration 
                  and had determined total mortality by intention to treat, regardless 
                  of sample size. Trials were identified based on literature review 
                  and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical firms. 
                  DATA EXTRACTION--Using standard tables, data were extracted 
                  by one author and confirmed where necessary by the other author 
                  or the principal investigator of the trial. Unpublished data 
                  were obtained by direct correspondence with the principal investigator 
                  of each study or pharmaceutical firm. DATA SYNTHESIS--The data 
                  for each outcome were combined using the Yusuf-Peto adaptation 
                  of the Mantel-Haenszel method. Overall, there was a statistically 
                  significant reduction in total mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 
                  95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.88; P &lt; .001) and 
                  in the combined endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for 
                  congestive heart failure (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.74; P 
                  &lt; .001). Similar benefits were observed with several different 
                  ACE inhibitors, although the data were largely based on enalapril 
                  maleate, captopril, ramipril, quinapril hydrochloride, and lisinopril. 
                  Reductions for total mortality and the combined endpoint were 
                  similar for various subgroups examined (age, sex, etiology, 
                  and New York Heart Association class). However, patients with 
                  the lowest ejection fraction appeared to have the greatest benefit. 
                  The greatest effect was seen during the first 3 months, but 
                  additional benefit was observed during further treatment. The 
                  reduction in mortality was primarily due to fewer deaths from 
                  progressive heart failure (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83); 
                  point estimates for effects on sudden or presumed arrhythmic 
                  deaths (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.12) and fatal myocardial 
                  infarction (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.11) were less than 1 
                  but were not significant. CONCLUSIONS--Total mortality and hospitalization 
                  for congestive heart failure are significantly reduced by ACE 
                  inhibitors with consistent effects in a broad range of patients.

                  Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality 
                  rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect 
                  of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on 
                  mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart 
                  failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. 
                  Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure 
                  were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) 
                  or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in 
                  a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients 
                  were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and 
                  III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 
                  510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared 
                  with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in 
                  risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; 
                  P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed 
                  in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction 
                  occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure 
                  (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction 
                  in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 
                  percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths 
                  classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer 
                  patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure 
                  (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk 
                  reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 
                  34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of 
                  enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality 
                  and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic 
                  congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. [<a href="#SOLVD" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_SOLVD1992.html','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See

                  <font color="663333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
                  association between raised renin levels and myocardial infarction 
                  has been reported. We studied the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting 
                  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the development of myocardial infarction 
                  and unstable angina in 6797 patients with ejection fractions 
                  &lt; or = 0.35 enrolled into the two Studies of Left Ventricular 
                  Dysfunction (SOLVD) trials. Patients were randomly assigned 
                  to placebo (n = 3401) or enalapril (n = 3396) at doses of 2.5-20 
                  mg per day in two concurrent double-blind trials with the same 
                  protocol. Patients with heart failure entered the treatment 
                  trial (n = 2569) and those without heart failure entered the 
                  prevention trial (n = 4228). Follow-up averaged 40 months. In 
                  each trial there were significant reductions in the number of 
                  patients developing myocardial infarction (treatment trial: 
                  158 placebo vs 127 enalapril, p &lt; 0.02; prevention trial: 
                  204 vs 161 p &lt; 0.01) or unstable angina (240 vs 187 p &lt; 
                  0.001; 355 vs 312, p &lt; 0.05). Combined, there were 362 placebo 
                  group patients with myocardial infarction compared with 288 
                  in the enalapril group (risk reduction 23%, 95% CI 11-34%; p 
                  &lt; 0.001). 595 placebo group patients developed unstable angina 
                  compared with 499 in the enalapril group (risk reduction 20%, 
                  95% CI 9-29%, p &lt; 0.001). There was also a reduction in cardiac 
                  deaths (711 placebo, 615 enalapril; p &lt; 0.003), so that the 
                  reduction in the combined endpoint of deaths, myocardial infarction, 
                  and unstable angina was highly significant (20% risk reduction, 
                  95% CI 14-26%; p &lt; 0.0001). Enalapril treatment significantly 
                  reduced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiac 
                  mortality in patients with low ejection fractions. </font><br>
