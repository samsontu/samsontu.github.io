<P CLASS="AbsHd">Objective</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">To determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity in symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF).</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Data Sources</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Studies were identified using MEDLINE and other databases, bibliographies of relevant articles, and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical firms. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Study Selection</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Published and unpublished studies were selected if they were randomized controlled trials of ACE inhibitors &ge; 8 weeks, included intention-to-treat data on total mortality, and did not compare active agents.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Data Extraction</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Individual ACE inhibitor, mortality (total and from CHF, sudden death, and myocardial infarction [MI]), length of hospitalization, and patient characteristics (numbers, age, sex, New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, ejection fraction, and cause of CHF [ischemic and nonischemic heart disease])</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main Results</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">32 trials (3870 patients receiving ACE inhibitors and 3235 receiving placebo) were included. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors had a lower total mortality than patients receiving placebo (15.8% vs. 21.9% {95% CI for the 6.1% absolute risk reduction [ARR], 4.3% to 8.0%; <I>P</I> &lt; 0.001; relative risk reduction [RRR], 28%; number needed to treat [NNT], 16; CI, 12 to 23}*) and a lower occurrence of mortality combined with hospitalization for CHF (22.4% vs. 32.6% {CI for 10.2% ARR, 8% to 12.3%; <I>P</I> &lt; 0.001; RRR, 31.2%; NNT, 10; CI, 8 to 12}*). Subgroup analyses showed that both enalapril and ramipril compared with placebo reduced the combined end point of mortality and hospitalization for CHF (enalapril: 42.3% vs. 50.3% {CI for 8% ARR, 4.7% to 11.4%; <I>P</I> &lt; 0.001; RRR, 15.9%; NNT, 12; CI, 9 to 21}* and ramipril: 4.9% vs. 9.2% {CI for the 4.2% ARR, 1.4% to 7.4%; <I>P</I> = 0.003; RRR, 46.5%; NNT, 23; CI, 14 to 71}*). Fewer patients receiving ACE inhibitors died of progressive CHF (6.5% vs. 10.5% {CI for the 4.0% ARR, 2.7% to 5.3%; <I>P</I> &lt; 0.05; RRR, 37.8%; NNT, 25; CI, 19 to 38}*). The reductions in mortality from CHF were greater for men than for women, for age &le; 60 years than for age &gt; 60 years, for NYHA class IV, for ejection fraction &le; 0.25, and for CHF caused by ischemic heart disease. The greatest effect was seen during the first 3 months of treatment. The groups did not differ for reductions in sudden death or fatal MI. </p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Conclusion</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Total mortality and mortality combined with hospitalization from congestive heart failure are reduced in patients with congestive heart failure who receive ACE inhibitors. </p>

<P CLASS="CmHd">Commentary</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">A recent wealth of evidence on the importance of neurohormonal mechanisms as orchestrators of the pathogenesis and outcome of heart failure has forced us to discard the common &quot;hemodynamic perturbation&quot; dogma that has existed for decades. Central to this theme is the verification of the benefits of pharmacologic modulation of neuroendocrine activity by ACE inhibitors at all stages of symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (1). ACE inhibitors are currently essential for treating CHF. Important questions, however, remain unanswered: Are all ACE inhibitors of similar benefit? Do all patients with CHF benefit equally? What is the mode of mortality reduction? What is the appropriate dose range? Garg and Yusuf address these first 3 issues.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">Besides the reinforcement of individual trial suggestions of a clear reduction in the number of hospitalizations and death in symptomatic CHF, this incisive meta-analysis provides the following clinically important information on ACE inhibitors: 1) The reduction in mortality may be caused by a reduction in progressive CHF; 2) the benefit appears consistent among various ACE inhibitors, suggesting a class effect; 3) the benefit occurs and is most marked in the first 3 months of treatment; and 4) the patients likely to receive the greatest benefit are those with the lowest ejection fraction.</p>
<P CLASS="CmTxt">This meta-analysis makes a compelling argument for the early and routine use of any ACE inhibitor in patients with symptomatic CHF. The high mortality in patients who are optimally treated for CHF, however, indicates that the problem is far from solved. The challenge is now to develop strategies that prevent ventricular dysfunction from progressing to symptomatic CHF. </p>
