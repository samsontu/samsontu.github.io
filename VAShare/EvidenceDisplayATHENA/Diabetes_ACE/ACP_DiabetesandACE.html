                      did not differ among the 3 target groups. Regression analysis 
                      showed that most of the reduction in CV events occurred 
                      with reduction of diastolic BP from the baseline of 105

                    <p class="CmTxt">The major finding of the HOT trial is that 
                      aspirin, 75 mg/d, significantly reduced CV events in persons 
                      with hypertension. The HOT trial also provides insight into 
                      the extent to which diastolic BP should be reduced to prevent 
                      CV events. Reducing diastolic BP below 85 mm Hg did not 
                      reduce CV events. In the subgroup of patients with diabetes, 
                      reducing diastolic BP from 85 to 81 mm Hg decreased CV events. 
                      These data suggest that the goal diastolic BP should be 
                      85 to 90 mm Hg for patients with hypertension but not diabetes 
                      and approximately 80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes.</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">Does the HOT trial tell us which antihypertensive 
                      agents are best? It does not. The authors found that the 
                      CV event rates in the HOT trial were lower than those seen 
                      in previous trials, and no control group was included.</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">3 randomized trials suggest that dihydropyridine-type 
                      calcium channel blockers, such as felodipine, are inferior 
                      to other antihypertensive agents. In patients with hypertension, 
                      1 trial (1) showed that hydrochlorothiazide was superior 
                      to isradipine in the prevention of angina with a 3-year 
                      number needed to treat (NNT) of 55 (CI 44 to 1289). In patients 
                      with diabetes and hypertension, another trial (2) showed 
                      that enalapril was superior to nisoldipine in the prevention 
                      of myocardial infarction with a 5-year NNT of 12 (CI 10 
                      to 19). A third trial (3) showed that fosinopril was superior 
                      to amlopidine in the prevention of CV events with a 3-year 
                      NNT of 15 (CI 10 to 185).</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">Until further trials are published, we should 
                      treat hypertension with proven and less expensive medications, 
                      such as low-dose thiazides and ACE inhibitors.</p>

                      disease (Table).</p>
                    <p class="AbsTxt">Based on the use of resources associated 
                      with the trial protocol, over the median follow-up period 
                      tight control increased the total cost of treatment by &pound;740/patient 
                      compared with less tight control but reduced the total cost 
                      of complications by &pound;949/patient (a net savings of 
                      &pound;209/patient, undiscounted values). By the simulation

                      did not increase life expectancy. Based on estimates of

                    <p class="CmTxt">The UKPDS shows that meticulous blood pressure 
                      reduction is important in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
                      This finding has major implications for health care because 
                      of the projected dramatic increase in diabetes in the future 
                      and the clear relation between diabetes and hypertension. 
                      The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) 
                      has shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces cardiovascular 
                      events in elderly patients with and without diabetes (1). 
                      The present trial consolidates this information and extends 
                      the findings to younger patients and to patients with newly 
                      detected diabetes. The results are consistent with the recently 
                      published Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study, in 
                      which intensive blood pressure lowering was more effective 
                      in reducing cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes 
                      than among those without diabetes (2). In addition, the 
                      UKPDS shows that intensive blood pressure control reduces 
                      microvascular complications, which is an outcome that has 
                      not been addressed in previous studies of hypertension management 
                      in patients with diabetes.</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">The mean blood pressure of 144/82 mm Hg achieved 
                      in the UKPDS is similar to the blood pressure achieved in 
                      the SHEP study. It is, however, higher than that attained 
                      in the HOT study, which showed that the lowest targeted 
                      diastolic blood pressure was most protective, especially 
                      among patients with diabetes. Taken together, these studies 
                      provide no evidence for any negative effect of blood pressure 
                      lowering. Therefore, assuming a curvilinear relation between 
                      cardiovascular disease and hypertension, the treatment goal 
                      should be 140/80 mm Hg or possibly lower. To achieve this 
                      goal, multi-drug treatment may be needed. In the UKPDS, 
                      almost one third of the intensively treated patients were 
                      receiving at least 3 drugs.</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">The UKPDS also showed that &beta;-blockers 
                      and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were equally 
                      effective in preventing macrovascular and microvascular 
                      events (3). The SHEP study used chlorthalidone and the HOT 
                      study used felodipine as initial therapy. This shows that 
                      blood pressure reduction itself is more important than the 
                      pharmacologic tool by which reduction is achieved. However, 
                      the effectiveness of monotherapy with calcium channel blockers 
                      is uncertain and awaits further evidence (4).</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">The UKPDS investigators performed a cost-effectiveness 
                      analysis based on the use of the resources in the trial 
                      protocol. These costs were transformed to show the resources 
                      that would be needed for the same treatment in standard 
                      clinical practice. Tight blood pressure control in patients 
                      with type 2 diabetes was cost-effective. The analyses did 
                      not consider the full societal perspective because the indirect 
                      cost of morbidity and the increased future costs from increased 
                      life expectancy were not included in the analysis. However, 
                      the data are strong enough to support the overall conclusion 
                      from this broader perspective.</p>
                    <p class="CmTxt">In summary, the UKPDS confirms that tight 
                      blood pressure control is key to the treatment of type 2 
                      diabetes. Apart from protecting patients from unnecessary 
                      suffering, it is cost-effective. However, it should be emphasized 
                      that blood pressure control is just part of a holistic approach 
                      to the care of patients with diabetes. Comprehensive care 
                      should include glycemic control and meticulous evaluation 
                      and treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, such 
                      as dyslipidemia and smoking.</p>
