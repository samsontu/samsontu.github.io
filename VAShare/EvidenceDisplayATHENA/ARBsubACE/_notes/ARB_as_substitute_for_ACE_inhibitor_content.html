  they are not associated with the intractable dry cough seen in some patients 
  taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers are indicated in patients 
  who require an ACE inhibitor but who cannot tolerate it due to drug-induced 
  dry cough.(Therapeutics Letter, issue 28, January/February/March 1999)</font></P>

<P><font color="660033" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Angiotensin-II 
  receptor antagonists are well tolerated. Cough occurs much less often with these 
  agents than with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and they do not adversely 
  affect lipid profiles or cause rebound hypertension after discontinuation. Clinical 
  trials indicate that angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are effective and safe 
  in the treatment of hypertension. </font></P>
