  antihypertensive drug treatment reduces the risk for stroke (nonfatal and fatal) 
  in men and women &ge; 60 years of age with isolated systolic hypertension.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Design</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 5 years.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Setting</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Community recruitment to 16 tertiary care centers.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Patients</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">4736 persons with isolated systolic hypertension (mean systolic blood pressure [SBP] &ge; 160 mm Hg and mean diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &lt; 90 mm Hg) were enrolled after screening 447 921 persons. 57% were women; 14% were black; the mean age was 72 years; mean SBP, 170 mm Hg; and mean DBP, 77 mm Hg; 61 % had abnormal ECGs; 33% entered after withdrawal of previous antihypertensive agents. Patients with major medical diseases were excluded. Follow-up was 99.8% and averaged 4.5 years.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Intervention</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">The goal of therapy was a SBP &lt; 160 mm Hg and a reduction 
  in SBP of at least 20 mm Hg using the lowest possible dose of medicine. BP was 
  monitored monthly, and drug therapy (with active drug or placebo) was adjusted 
  in 4 consecutive steps: chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d; increase to chlorthalidone, 
  25mg/d; addition of atenolol, 25 mg/d, or reserpine, 0.05 mg/d; increase to 
  atenolol, 50 mg/d, or reserpine, 0.1 mg/d. Any patient with sustained SBP &gt; 
  220 mm Hg or DBP &gt; 90 mm Hg was given active treatment.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main outcome measures</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Fatal and nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular events, and mortality.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsHd">Main results</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">At 5 years, 90% of the study group and 44% of controls were 
  on active treatment. Two thirds of patients assigned to treatment and one third 
  of controls achieved the SBP goal. (65 % to 72% vs 32% to 40%) 103 persons (4%) 
  assigned to treatment had strokes (10<FONT COLOR=RED></FONT> fatal) compared 
  with 159 (7%) in the control group (14 fatal){<I>P </I>&lt; 0.001}* {This absolute 
  risk reduction (ARR) of 3% means that 43 patients would need to be treated (NNT) 
  with antihypertensive drug treatment (compared with placebo) to prevent 1 additional 
  stroke, 95% CI 27 to 95; the relative risk reduction (RRR) was 35%, CI 17% to 
  49%}.* <FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE></strike></font>Fewer <FONT COLOR=RED></FONT>patients

  reach statistically significant (9% vs 10%, <I>P</I> = 0.2) {ARR 1%, CI -0.5%

<P CLASS="AbsHd">Conclusion</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">Stepped-care treatment with chlorthalidone, and atenolol or 
  reserpine if required, of persons &ge; 60 years of age with isolated systolic 
  hypertension reduced strokes by 36% and had other favorable cardiovascular effects.</p>

<P CLASS="CmHd">Commentary</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">This study is impressive for its size, scientific rigor, and 
  favorable results. Many physicians have been concerned with the risk of treating 
  elderly persons with isolated systolic hypertension, especially because a J- 
  or U-shaped relation<FONT COLOR=RED></FONT> between diastolic blood pressure 
  and mortality has been described (1). This study lays those concerns to rest.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">The absolute risk reduction of 3% over 5 years might appear 
  unimpressively small. 2<FONT COLOR=RED><STRIKE></strike></font> factors, however, 
  need to be taken into account. First, the results compare favorably with other 
  current treatments to prevent stroke or heart disease. On the assumption that 
  event rates would remain constant over the clinically more sensible period of 
  10 years, the study results suggest that treating 100 elderly patients would 
  prevent 6 strokes, 2 heart attacks, 5 cases of congestive heart failure, and 
  2 deaths, whereas 7 patients would have intolerable adverse effects from therapy.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">The second factor to consider in interpreting these results is that the data were analyzed according to the groups to which patients were assigned, not according to whether patients actually took the medicine or achieved the target blood pressure. At 5 years, 90% of patients in the treatment group were<I> </I>on treatment but only two thirds achieved their blood pressure goal, whereas 44% of patients in the control group were treated and one third were at goal. Thus, the results of this study underestimate the benefits of <I>successfully treating</I> isolated systolic hypertension.</p>
<P CLASS="AbsTxt">These factors, when combined with the reasonable cost and convenience (once a day), suggest that the stepped-care treatment program is clinically worthwhile.</p>
