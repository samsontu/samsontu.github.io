                  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="663333">BACKGROUND: 
                    Previous meta-analysis of outcome trials in hypertension have 
                    not specifically focused on isolated systolic hypertension 
                    or they have explained treatment benefit mainly in function 
                    of the achieved diastolic blood pressure reduction. We therefore 
                    undertook a quantitative overview of the trials to further 
                    evaluate the risks associated with systolic blood pressure 
                    in treated and untreated older patients with isolated systolic 
                    hypertension METHODS: Patients were 60 years old or more. 
                    Systolic blood pressure was 160 mm Hg or greater and diastolic 
                    blood pressure was less than 95 mm Hg. We used non-parametric 
                    methods and Cox regression to model the risks associated with 
                    blood pressure and to correct for regression dilution bias. 
                    We calculated pooled effects of treatment from stratified 
                    2 x 2 contingency tables after application of Zelen's test 
                    of heterogeneity. FINDINGS: In eight trials 15 693 patients 
                    with isolated systolic hypertension were followed up for 3.8 
                    years (median). After correction for regression dilution bias, 
                    sex, age, and diastolic blood pressure, the relative hazard 
                    rates associated with a 10 mm Hg higher initial systolic blood 
                    pressure were 1.26 (p=0.0001) for total mortality, 1.22 (p=0.02) 
                    for stroke, but only 1.07 (p=0.37) for coronary events. Independent 
                    of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure was inversely 
                    correlated with total mortality, highlighting the role of 
                    pulse pressure as risk factor. Active treatment reduced total 
                    mortality by 13% (95% CI 2-22, p=0.02), cardiovascular mortality 
                    by 18%, all cardiovascular complications by 26%, stroke by 
                    30%, and coronary events by 23%. The number of patients to 
                    treat for 5 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event 
                    was lower in men (18 vs 38), at or above age 70 (19 vs 39), 
                    and in patients with previous cardiovascular complications 
                    (16 vs 37). INTERPRETATION: Drug treatment is justified in 
                    older patients with isolated systolic hypertension whose systolic 
                    blood pressure is 160 mm Hg or higher. Absolute benefit is 
                    larger in men, in patients aged 70 or more and in those with 
                    previous cardiovascular complications or wider pulse pressure. 
                    Treatment prevented stroke more effectively than coronary 
                    events. However, the absence of a relation between coronary 
                    events and systolic blood pressure in untreated patients suggests 
                    that the coronary protection may have been underestimated.</font><br>

                    To assess antihypertensive efficacy of beta-blockers and their 
                    effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and all-cause 
                    morbidity compared with diuretics in elderly patients with 
                    hypertension. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search of English-language 
                    articles published between January 1966 and January 1998 using 
                    the terms hypertension (drug therapy) and elderly or aged 
                    or geriatric, and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases, 
                    and morbidity or mortality. References from identified articles 
                    were also reviewed. DATA SELECTION: Randomized trials lasting 
                    at least 1 year, which used as first-line agents diuretics 
                    and/or beta-blockers, and reported morbidity and mortality 
                    outcomes in elderly patients with hypertension. DATA SYNTHESIS 
                    AND RESULTS: Ten trials involving a total of 16164 elderly 
                    patients (&gt; or =60 years) were included. Two thirds of 
                    the patients assigned to diuretics were well controlled on 
                    monotherapy, whereas less than a third of the patients assigned 
                    to beta-blockers were well controlled on monotherapy. Diuretic 
                    therapy was superior to beta-blockade with regard to all end 
                    points and was effective in preventing cerebrovascular events 
                    (odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.72), 
                    fatal stroke (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.90), coronary heart 
                    disease (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85), cardiovascular mortality 
                    (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64-0.87), and all-cause mortality (OR, 
                    0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96). In contrast, beta-blocker therapy 
                    only reduced the odds for cerebrovascular events (OR, 0.75; 
                    95% CI, 0.57-0.98) but was ineffective in preventing coronary 
                    heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality 
                    (ORs, 1.01, 0.98, and 1.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In 
                    contrast to diuretics, which remain the standard first-line 
                    therapy, beta-blockers, until proven otherwise, should no 
                    longer be considered appropriate first-line therapy of uncomplicated 
                    hypertension in the elderly hypertensive patient. [<a href="#Messerli" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_Messerli1998.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See

                    establish whether treatment with diuretic or beta blocker 
                    in hypertensive older adults reduces risk of stroke, coronary 
                    heart disease, and death. DESIGN--Randomised, placebo controlled, 
                    single blind trial. SETTING--226 general practices in the 
                    MRC general practice research framework. SUBJECTS--4396 patients 
                    aged 65-74 randomised to receive diuretic, beta blocker, or 
                    placebo. Patients had mean systolic pressures of 160-209 mm 
                    Hg and mean diastolic pressures less than 115 mm Hg during 
                    an eight week run in and were not taking antihypertensive 
                    treatment. INTERVENTION--Patients were randomised to atenolol 
                    50 mg daily; hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg or 50 mg plus amiloride 
                    2.5 mg or 5 mg daily; or placebo. The regimens were adjusted 
                    to achieve specified target pressures. Mean follow up was 
                    5.8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Strokes, coronary events, 
                    and deaths from all causes. RESULTS--Both treatments reduced 
                    blood pressure below the level in the placebo group. Compared 
                    with the placebo group, actively treated subjects (diuretic 
                    and beta blocker groups combined) had a 25% (95% confidence 
                    interval 3% to 42%) reduction in stroke (p = 0.04), 19% (-2% 
                    to 36%) reduction in coronary events (p = 0.08), and 17% (2% 
                    to 29%) reduction in all cardiovascular events (p = 0.03). 
                    After adjusting for baseline characteristics the diuretic 
                    group had significantly reduced risks of stroke (31% (3% to 
                    51%) p = 0.04), coronary events (44% (21% to 60%), p = 0.0009), 
                    and all cardiovascular events (35% (17% to 49%), p = 0.0005) 
                    compared with the placebo group. The beta blocker group showed 
                    no significant reductions in these end points. The reduction 
                    in strokes was mainly in non-smokers taking the diuretic. 
                    CONCLUSION--Hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride reduce the risk 
                    of stroke, coronary events, and all cardiovascular events 
                    in older hypertensive adults.<br>

                    placebo-controlled. SETTING. Community-based ambulatory population 
                    in tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS. 4736 persons (1.06%) 
                    from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized 
                    (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood 
                    pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood 
                    pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 
                    were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial 
                    contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure 
                    was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. 
                    The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black. 
                    INTERVENTIONS.--Participants were stratified by clinical center 
                    and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. 
                    For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, 
                    or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 
                    1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 
                    mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Primary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) 
                    stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and 
                    mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. 
                    RESULTS. Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average 
                    systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group 
                    and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year 
                    average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. 
                    The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants 
                    for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative 
                    risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 
                    (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal 
                    myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk 
                    was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative 
                    risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk 
                    was 0.87. CONCLUSION. In persons aged 60 years and over with 
                    isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care 
                    drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication 
                    reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year 
                    absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major 
                    cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit 
                    of 55 events per 1000. [<a href="#SHEP" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Indiv_SHEP1991.html','','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=550')">See
